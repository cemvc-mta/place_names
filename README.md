# CEMVC Place Name Policy Collection

This repository is used to the build the [CEMVC Place Name Policy digital repository](https://placenames.cemvc.ca). This collection contains hundreds of place name policies for Canadian incorporated settlements and can be searched by topic (i.e., Indigenous, women, veteran), geographical location (i.e., Calgary, London, Sackville), or browsed by province, territory, and so on. The database was created for ongoing research by Dr. Lauren Beck at Mount Allison University and the [Centre for Early Modern Visual Culture](https://www.cemvc.ca).

# CEMVC

The [Centre for Early Modern Visual Culture](https://www.cemvc.ca) offers research collections focused primarily on illustrations, engravings, and maps published in books between 1400 and 1900. Our researchers examine critical questions about visuality and textuality from this period, questions that continue to impact how we see the world around us today. These inquiries revolve around gender, race, class, and place of origin in the settler-colonial milieu, as well as how images and text become powerfully technologized in the present era. Scholars of the digital humanities, history, art history, and literature will find these collections particularly useful for their research.
