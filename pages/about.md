## The Collection

This site is a catalogue of place names and place name policies. The content is based on ongoing research by Dr. Lauren Beck, the [Centre for Early Modern Visual Culture](https://www.cemvc.ca) at Mount Allison University (Sackville, NB), and various contributors from around Canada.

## The CEMVC

The [Centre for Early Modern Visual Culture](https://www.cemvc.ca) offers research collections focused primarily on illustrations, engravings, and maps published in books between 1400 and 1900. Our researchers examine critical questions about visuality and textuality from this period, questions that continue to impact how we see the world around us today. These inquiries revolve around gender, race, class, and place of origin in the settler-colonial milieu, as well as how images and text become powerfully technologized in the present era. Scholars of the digital humanities, history, art history, and literature will find these collections particularly useful for their research.
