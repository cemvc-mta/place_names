## About the Collection

This site is a catalogue of place names and their history. The content is based on ongoing research by the [Centre for Early Modern Visual Culture](https://www.cemvc.ca) at Mount Allison Univertiy (Sackville, NB, Canada).

## About the CEMVC

The Centre for Early Modern Visual Culture offers research collections focused primarily on illustrations, engravings, and maps published in books between 1400 and 1900. Our researchers examine critical questions about visuality from this period, questions that continue to impact how we see the world around us today. These inquiries revolve around gender, race, class, place of origin, and how images become powerfully technologized in the present era. Scholars of the digital humanities, history, art history, and literature will find these collections particularly useful for their research.
