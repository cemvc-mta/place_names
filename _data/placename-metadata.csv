The naming of public streets, trails and civic facilities shall also provide the opportunity to recognize, reflect and commemorate people, events, places, wildlife, flora, fauna and natural features that are associated with the City of Moncton, New Brunswick or Canada.<br>3. It is important to the City of Moncton to support and celebrate the two official languages and linguistic communities, promote a value and source of pride that they represent through their unique cultures, and foster a sense of belonging and true equality for all of its citizens. Names selected for its public streets, trails and civic facilities shall reflect and celebrate the historical, cultural, ethnic and linguistic characteristics of the community and citizens shall have an opportunity to contribute to the naming process.<br>4.

The City will continue to rely upon the name bank to serve as a primary source of potential names for public streets, trails and civic facilities. Alternate names, not found in the Name Bank, may be considered by City Council in special circumstances, as detailed in the Naming Policy.<br>6. A Staff Name Bank Technical Group will be responsible for updating and maintaining the Moncton Name Bank and ensuring compliance with the Naming Policy.<br>7. All proposed names to be added or retired from the Moncton Name Bank and the proposed names of all public streets, trails and civic facilities shall be forwarded to Moncton City Council for approval.<br>8. The process and requirements for naming streets, trails and civic facilities will be clearly outlined and made available for the public and development community to access on the City’s website.<br>4. General Naming Criteria<br>1. To ensure that emergency services and individuals can locate addresses and facilities easily and without confusion:<br>a. All proposed names shall be unique. There shall be no duplication of names within the City of Moncton or with names already existing in adjoining communities that share emergency service providers (Fire and RCMP). In addition:<br>i.

novascotia_annapoliscounty,,record,Annapolis County,Nova Scotia,Yes,"Street Naming: <br><br>Naming of roads, streets and communities and the adjustment of community boundaries is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions and established practices of the Department of Transportation & Public Works and the Municipality. Procedures must be consistent to ensure that the integrity of the civic addressing system is maintained. This policy defines the steps that shall be followed when it is proposed that:  the name of an existing road or street (public or private) be changed or the name or boundaries of a community be changed; or  the Municipality assign the name of a new road, street or road reserve as a result of subdivision of land pursuant to the Subdivision Bylaw; or  the Municipality assign the name of a new private road or street or road reserve as a result of subdivision of land pursuant to the Subdivision Bylaw; or  a name be assigned to an existing road or community not previously named. New names for roads, streets and communities will be carefully reviewed to minimize the potential for conflicts with existing names. Changing the name of a road, street or community has important historical and public safety implications with preference or greater consideration to be given to the traditional name acknowledged by local residents. Accordingly, a name change should only be considered in a very limited number of situations. Emergency responder services shall be consulted as a part of any civic address change process. <br><br>BASIC POLICY PRINCIPLES 4.1 Procedures and evaluation criteria. Unless otherwise stated, the procedures and evaluation criteria are to be in accordance with the guidelines specified in the Nova Scotia Civic Address File (NSCAF) Pilot Project - Final Report. 4.2 Duplication, numbers, suffixes or prefixes are to be avoided. There should be no duplication or near duplication of road and community names within the Municipality. Numerals should not appear in a road or community name nor names differentiated by just a prefix or suffix. Examples - If Bayview Boulevard exists in the County, this name (with or without add-ons) would not be accepted for another community in the County. - Since the community of Port Lorne exists, this name (with or without changes in prefixes or suffixes) would not be accepted for another community in the County (such as Fort Lorne, Upper Port Lorne, Port Lorne Extension). - 1 st Avenue or 2nd Street would not be acceptable. - First Avenue or Second Street would be acceptable. - Upper Station Road or Lower Water Street would not be acceptable. - If Portland Road exists, the name Portland Street would not be acceptable. <br><br>4.3 Confusion is to be avoided. In order to minimize diction problems when reporting road names under stress, names that sound very similar are to be avoided. Examples - If Smith Road exists; then Smyth Road, Smith’s Road or Smit Road would not be accepted. - Since the community of Lawrencetown exists, then Lorncetown, Laurencetown, Lewiston or Lawrenceville would not be accepted. 4.4 Continuity of road name to be a criteria. A road running in one compass direction should have one name only and should, at least within a community, have the same name throughout its entire length. 4.5 Changing an existing name is to be discouraged. A request to change the name of a road, street or community will be considered only if: 4.5.1 there are valid public safety considerations which affect the civic address system and/or the E911 database; or 4.5.2 valid issues have been sufficiently documented and adequately presented relative to community identity, heritage and traditions; and 4.5.3 property owners have been adequately informed and a 2/3 majority or greater of area residents support the change of road name as evidenced by a community survey in an approved format; or 4.5.4 there are important civic objectives or purposes which may be achieved by approving a change; and 4.5.5 the change is approved by Municipal Council. <br><br>EVALUATION CRITERIA <br><br>5.1 General Criteria 5.1.1 Names that existed prior to approval of this policy are hereby accepted unless the Civic Addressing Coordinator determines a change in name is necessary. 5.1.2 Only English or French versions will be accepted, with appropriate accents being applied in accordance to the rules of the language and the English version being easy to pronounce, recognizable and easy to spell. 5.1.3 The long-standing, local usage of the name by the local public will be given preference. 5.1.4 Names must reflect good taste as perceived by the general public. 5.1.5 Names submitted with special characters will only be accepted if found in the ASCH special character set (See Schedule A) 5.1.6 Qualifying words (upper, lower, new, old, north, south, east, west, etc.) will not be accepted for proposed changes or new names unless such qualifier is found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer or if approved by the Civic Addressing Coordinator. 5.1.7 All names for roads or streets must have an associated road type, and only road types identified in Section 5.3 will be accepted. 5.1.8 Road names containing a number must be alphanumeric (such as First Street) and submissions using a numeric (such as 1st Street) will not be accepted. 5.1.9 Name submissions for communities and roads (including road type) shall have a total of no more than 35 characters. 5.1.10 The following identifiers or references are not acceptable: (1) homonyms or like sounding names within the Municipality; for example, “Smith”, Smyth”, Smythe”, “Smith’s”, “Smiths”, “Smit” or “Smits”. <br><br>(2) a personal name (combination of given and surname) unless such application is in the public interest. (The person commemorated should have contributed significantly to the area where the road is located and the adoption of the personal name during the lifetime of the person concerned should only be made in exceptional circumstances.) (3) formal titles of distinctions associated with a person name such as Captain, Major or Doctor. (4) company or commercial product names and names associated with copyright or trademarks. 5.1.11 Ownership of land should not in itself be grounds for the application of the owner’s name to a road or community, nor does ownership confer the right to specify the name without consultation with area residents. 5.1.12 Mixed language name submissions should be avoided (example: Chapeau Road or Port Petite community). <br><br>Road Types Only the following road types will be accepted for name submissions:  <br><br>Type – Code - Definition  <br><br>Avenue (also Fr.) - Ave - A thoroughfare in an urban setting that is used primarily for local traffic.  <br><br>Boulevard (also Fr.) - Blvd  - A major thoroughfare running in a diagonal direction and usually with a landscaped center.  <br><br>Court (also Fr.) - Crt  - A short drive usually less than 300 metres, branching  <br><br>Crescent – Cres - from an intersection and ending in a cul-de-sac or dead (Croissant-Fr.

novascotia_argyle,,record,Argyle,Nova Scotia,Yes,"1. All new private road and municipal street names shall conform with the following principles: 1.1. Avoid duplication - there should be no duplication of road names and numbers used as names should be avoided. It is also preferable not to differentiate road and street names exclusively by selecting a different road type, for example, Portland Road and Portland Drive. 1.2. Avoid confusion - road names that sound very similar should be avoided. The reason for avoiding similar or similar sounding names is to eliminate diction problems when people are reporting road names under stress. 1.3. Establish continuity - a road running in one compass direction should have one name only and should have the same name throughout its entire length in the Municipality and, if possible, in adjoining municipalities. 2. In particular, the following standards shall be applied: 2.1. Road names should be: a) easy to pronounce; b) comprised of recognizable words or acceptable combination of words; c) easy to spell for a person with intermediate reading level; d) take into account any long-standing local usage of name or words used in the name; e) in good taste; f) contain only those special characters which can be electronically recorded and manipulated with ease using varying conventional software, and shall exclude stylized symbols found in the Latin 1 ASCII set, for example, #, %, etc. 3. Qualifying words such as Upper, Lower, New, Old, etc., should be avoided unless the qualifying word has been applied in some other official context (for example as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer); 4. All names must have an associated road type and the road type should conform with the road type criteria in the attached Road Type Schedule “B”, but existing non- conforming road types may be continued to avoid the cost, confusion and disturbance of changing only a road type; 5. Road names must only contain letters and road names containing numbers will be rejected: for example, ""First Street"" would be acceptable, but ""1st"" Street"" would not be accepted. 6. Where a new road is a continuation of an existing road, wherever possible the new road will be given the same name as the existing road. 7. There will be no duplication of road names within the Municipality and, if possible, duplication of names with names used in immediately adjoining municipal units should be avoided. 8. Road names, including abbreviated road type, shall have no more than 35 characters. 9. If the road is named after a topographic feature or place name, the name should reflect the official name as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer. 10. Naming streets for individuals is a common practice, but typically it is only acceptable if the person is deceased, or noteworthy of such a request. Formal titles of distinction, such as Captain, Major, Admiral, etc., should be avoided. 11. Company or commercial product names and names associated with copyright or trademarks should be avoided. 12. Names containing words in languages other than English, French, and Mi’kmaw should be avoided except where a proper noun is used. 13. Words should be spelled correctly and names with mixed language should be avoided except to the extent of always using an English [or French] road type. <br><br>No Policy for naming other spaces.",Form for Street Name Change Suggestions: https://www.munargyle.com/policies/211-article-c25-naming-of-municipal-streets-and-private-roads/file.html,gistech@munargyle.com,43.795509,-65.856662

newfoundlandandlabrador_stjohns,,record,St. John's,Newfoundland and Labrador,Yes,"Street Naming: <br><br>This new policy provides formalized guidance for existing practices, while allowing the incorporation of best practices from other jurisdictions. The new Street Naming Advisory Committee (replacing the Nomenclature Committee) will review street naming applications received from both developers and the general public. The Committee will also solicit feedback from the Inclusion Advisory Committee, and other groups as required, in order to support a more equitable and diverse selection of names. The policy also addresses the issue of street renaming requests. Such requests will only be considered if there is an engineering rationale or the continued use of the name would not be in the best interest of the City. Requestors must be City residents or property owners and will need to provide a petition with support from a majority of property owners on the Street before the request will be processed for further consideration. <br><br>Key Considerations/Implications: 1. Budget/Financial Implications: There are no expected immediate financial implications and the policy will not result in any immediate cost increases. The policy does note that City will not reimburse any costs that may be incurred by any property owner due to reassignment. The naming and renaming of streets have associated costs for the City (signage, staff time, contractor time), which are not currently allocated in any budget. When seeking approval of a specific new street name or a street to be renamed, Council will be provided with an estimated cost for implementation. 2. Partners or Other Stakeholders:  Inclusion Advisory Committee (IAC)  St. John’s Regional Fire Department  Other emergency services (police, ambulance)  St. John’s Transportation Commission  Electrical utilities and telecommunications providers 3. Alignment with Strategic Directions/Adopted Plans: “An Effective City” Goal: “Work with our employees to improve organizational performance through effective processes and policies”. 4. Alignment with Adopted Plans: This policy will interact with the Development Regulations, as developers will be required to follow the new process for street naming. 5. Accessibility and Inclusion: The IAC will be consulted prior to adding names to the Reserved Street Names Inventory. 6. Legal or Policy Implications: The Office of the City Solicitor has reviewed and approved the policy. 7. Privacy Implications: Implementation of the policy will require compliance with the City’s Privacy Management Policy and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015. The City’s Access and Privacy Analyst was consulted during the development of the policy, procedures and related forms. 8. Engagement and Communications Considerations: Discussions with the Marketing and Communications Division have begun regarding communications of the new policy. Once the policy is operational, there will be ongoing engagement requirements for any street renaming and the Committee will discuss how to proceed with the Organizational Performance and Strategy Division. 9. Human Resource Implications: The policy will be implemented with existing human resources. However, should the City receive an influx of multiple requests for street renaming over a short period of time, additional resources may be required. 10.Procurement Implications: For streets that are named or renamed, there will be a need for contracted services to install signage, using approved procurement policies and procedures. 11.Information Technology Implications: Not applicable. 12.Other Implications: Not applicable. <br><br>No other place name policies",N/A,cityclerk@stjohns.ca,47.482197,-52.797069

Similar sounding names shall be avoided due to confusion it may create for citizens or emergency services. 1.2.2 Abbreviations in Community names are not permitted. 1.2.3 Names containing a hyphen or apostrophe are acceptable.

Themes must be simple and commonly understood, unless reflecting a theme of national or local significance; b. When there are many names in use throughout Calgary that could be associated with a proposed theme the proposed theme naming shall not be permitted; and g. Where words used within a theme are not easily recognized as being associated with the theme, prefixes may be used (e.g., Lake Bonavista, Lake Lucerne, Lake Tahoe, Lake Wasa, etc.). 2.2.17 Roadways shall utilize valid roadway types maintained by the Administration’s division responsible for addressing in order to: a. Reflect the hierarchy, topography and configuration of roadways; and b. Enable one roadway name to be used for several roadways, thus reducing the number of roadway names required for new Communities. 2.2.18 Cul-de-sac roadway types are to be used solely for non-through roadways: a. Where appropriate, all culs-de-sac accessible from the same through roadway shall share the same name as the through roadway; b. The practice of qualifying with numbers culs-de-sac sharing the same name and type (e.g., 100 James Place, 200 James Place, etc.) is endorsed where the culs-de-sac are accessed from the same roadway; and c. Generally, where a through roadway terminates across an intersection and into a cul-de-sac, the roadway type of the cul-desac shall be different from the roadway type of the through roadway. 2.2.19 Roadway types “Way” and “Bay” shall not be used with the same roadway name (e.g., “Marquis Way” and “Marquis Bay”). 2.2.20 Words used as roadway types (e.g., “Green”, “Park”, “View”, etc.) shall not be permitted for use in compound names selected as roadway names (e.g., Coventry Park Drive, Skyview View). 3.

Municipal Naming also serves as a means to celebrate our culture, role in the national park, and the unique identity of this mountain community, its heritage, geography, flora, fauna or natural features associated with the town. Town Council can commemorate important events or honour the outstanding achievements or significant community contributions of groups, organizations or individuals. Municipal Naming is applied in situations where the Town does not receive from external parties a financial contribution, goods or services, or when a contribution has been donated, but the external party does not seek reciprocal consideration. This policy complements the objectives of the Addressing Bylaw, which applies to naming of streets and roadways. <br><br> <br><br>Addressing Bylaw: <br><br>Authority 3.1 The Town Manager is authorized to make recommendations to Council in respect to: a) assigning names to Public Roadways, Private Roads and Lanes; and b) revising such names 3.2 Council shall confirm or amend by resolution any such recommendations of the Town Manager made pursuant to section 3.1. Process 3.3 In making recommendations to Council, the Town Manager shall be bound by the following: a) Notwithstanding Subsection (c), all roads except minor thoroughfares shall each be assigned one (1) name, and except to identify a different type of thoroughfare, such name shall not be assigned to more than one (1) road; b) Roads may be named after animals or trees native to Banff National Park, national parks, geological features, topographical features, or anything else Council considers appropriate; c) Where it is considered that a Lane is used as the primary access to one (1) or more abutting Properties, such a Lane may be assigned a name. 4.1 The Town Manager is authorized to: a) assign Civic Address Numbers to Parcels of land and Buildings; b) amend, designate or re-designate Civic Address Numbers in consideration of public safety and/or service delivery; c) append a Unit number to a Civic Address Number in order to clearly address Units; d) amend, designate or re-designate Unit numbers in consideration of public safety and/or service delivery. 4.2 No compensation shall be payable to the Owner or occupants of a Property in conjunction with the exercise of the authority delegated in section 4.1. <br><br>New or Amended Addressing 7.1 The Town Manager shall give the Owner of a Property at least thirty (30) days’ notice in writing of any Civic Address Number assigned to such Property, pursuant to this Bylaw; Page 6 of 8 Town of Banff Bylaw 109-2 – Addressing Bylaw 7.2 Notice may be given a) by personal delivery to the Owner, or b) by mail delivery to the address for the Owner shown on the tax roll, or c) by email to the Owner.",N/A,municipal.clerk@banff.ca,51.177778,-115.573611

The Town will consider proposals for street naming but is under no obligation to accept a proposal to name, or rename a street, or assign a ceremonial name to a Street. b. Street names, including ceremonial Street names should portray a strong positive image and have historical, cultural or social significance or contributions to the community, the Town, the Province of Alberta or Canada. c. Street names shall not impair the ability of First Responders to respond to emergencies or impair the Town’s ability to deliver services. d. Streets that have been named, renamed, or assigned a ceremonial name within the previous ten years will not be renamed. e. Suffixes for Street names are assigned by Infrastructure Services to ensure the appropriate suffix is used to describe the type, function, length and configuration of the Street. f. All Town costs involved in renaming a Street shall be the responsibility of the individual requesting a street name or renaming or ceremonial name. g. Street names, including ceremonial names, shall not: i. Result in, or be perceived to confer, any competitive advantage, benefit or preferential treatment or advertisement to the named party, or a development, product, service or a particular business; ii. Be or be perceived to be discriminatory or derogatory of race, colour, ethnic origin, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual orientation, creed, political affiliation, disability or other social factors; iii.

In circumstances, where a specific Street or location is not identified, Infrastructure Services will provide Street location options in a report to Council. <br><br> <br><br>Statement from senior town planner: <br><br>  <br><br>""We do not have a 'name bank' as such. Historically, western settlements have adopted the simple numeric naming formula (i.e. 1st Street/Ave, 2nd Street/Ave, etc). This naming convention aligns very well with the grid system street network that is the prevailing urban development pattern for prairie communities.  <br><br>  <br><br>Typically the numbering will be centred on a main thoroughfare which was often the railroad. You can see this in many southern Alberta communities which have a 'Railway Avenue', 'Main Street' or 'Centre Street' that is usually located adjacent to the historic rail line. <br><br>  <br><br>With regards to new development, our naming conventions are oftentimes tied to the specific subdivision. For example: the streets within the 'Parkside Acres' subdivision in Coaldale are 'Parkside Green', 'Parkside Drive', and 'Parkside Way'. Streets within the 'Cottonwood Estates' are named after different types of trees (i.e. Aspen Drive, Cedar Crescent, Elm Place, etc.). These names may be proposed by the developer, but must be ultimately approved by the Town Council. <br><br>  <br><br>In terms of place naming, there are a few possible methods: <br><br>- the place is named for a benefactor, donor or sponsor (i.e. Kinship Park for the Kinsmen Club of Coaldale) <br><br>- the place is named by the developer when they plan a subdivision for the area (i.e. Cottonwood Park is within the Cottonwood Estates subdivision)'""",N/A,hailey.winder@coaldale.ca,49.727778,-112.618611

alberta_cochrane,,record,Cochrane,Alberta,Yes,"Naming of Streets and Public Areas: <br><br>Policy Statement: The Town will name municipal parks, pathways, natural areas or other public facilities to honour individuals or groups in recognition of their historical significance, volunteer contribution or national/international celebrity status. The Town will ensure that all local streets and major roadways are named in accordance with this Policy. 1. Reason for Policy 1.1 The Town of Cochrane believes in the naming of public areas to honour individuals, families and/or organizations that have made significant contributions to the community. Contributions that have been made in the following areas may be recognized:  Volunteerism  Historical  Celebrity  Honorary 1.2 The Town of Cochrane believes in naming streets to provide a sense of community within developments, and to recognize natural, historical or environmental features, and/or contributing persons and organizations of the Town, in the naming of major roadways. <br><br>1. General Guidelines 1.1 The Parks and Facilities Section will maintain a list of all public areas that may be named in honour of individuals, families or organizations. Public parks/natural areas to be named should be not less than one acre in size. Pathways to be named shall have a natural start and end point and should be not less than one kilometre in length. 1.2 The Planning Services Section will maintain a database of all street names and will work with developers to ensure that no local street or major roadways names are duplicated within the Town of Cochrane. 2. Naming of Streets 2.1 The names of collector or arterial streets which traverse more than one subdivision or community area should reflect natural, historical or environmental features, or contributing persons/organizations of the Town (i.e. Big Hill, Bow River, Quigley, George Fox etc.). 2.2 A list of recommended names for major roadways shall be prepared by Planning Services, with the assistance of the Cochrane and Area Heritage Association or the Cochrane Historical Archival and Preservation Society as required. 2.3 Planning Services shall provide a recommended list of names for major roadways to landowners over which a major roadway will traverse. 2.4 Local streets and major roadway names shall be suggested by developers at the time of subdivision and approved as part of the Subdivision Approval process. In the event that a major roadway is developed outside of the subdivision process, the Senior Leadership Team will determine roadway name. 2.5 Where suitable, the name of local streets shall be prefixed with the name or names associated with the subdivision or community area in which they are located (i.e. Gleneagles Close, Eagleview Way). 2.5 Where suitable, the name of local streets shall be prefixed with the name or names associated with the subdivision or community area in which they are located (i.e. Gleneagles Close, Eagleview Way). 3. Naming of Public Areas 3.1 In naming a public area, the name shall not be duplicated nor shall it approximate phonetically the name of any other public areas, already named within the Town of Cochrane or within the urban fringe area having regard to the possibility of future annexation. 3.2 The name may have some historical significance to Cochrane such that the name shall reflect aboriginal activity and original names in the local area, early pioneers; or pioneering ethnic groups who resetiled and developed the town and surrounding areas; or persons who have contributed to and/or pafticipated in a broad range of public services and / or com mu nity activities. 3,3 The Town of Cochrane shall encourage suggestions for the naming of public areas. Suggestions should clearly state the historical significance; volunteerism, contribution, or celebrity of the individual, family or organization to be honored. 3.4 All suggested names will be referred to the Cochrane and Area Heritage Association and the Cochrane Historical and Archival Preservation Society for review and recommendation to Council. 3.5 Council will review the recommendations from the Cochrane and Area Heritage Association and the Cochrane Historical and Archival Preservation Society and designate public areas to be named in honor of the organization, individual, or family suggested. 3,6 All submissions shall be received confidentially and reviewed ""In Camera"" by Council. Only submissions that are chosen will be identified publicly. 3,7 The Parks and Facilities Section will prepare and install appropriate signage identifying the names of public areas 3.8 Parkland that is dedicated for the development of schools and school playfields should be named by the school jurisdiction constructing the school. <br><br>Quote from the city:  <br><br>“We informally use Airdrie’s street naming policy for neighbourhoods (which encourages the use of a neighbourhood theme and a variety of suffixes to denote the style of roadway such a cul-de-sac vs a main entrance, vs a crescent,etc) while having a numbered grid system in the traditional downtown.  We do not have a name bank, but when asked we do partner with the Stockman’s Library (which is a local archival library), CHAPS (the Cochrane Historical Archival & Preservation Society) and our organization is slowly making more connections with the indigenous nations that abut our municipality to provide some options.

The reason for avoiding similar or similar sounding names is to eliminate diction problems when people are reporting road names under stress. <br><br>(3) Establish continuity - a road running in one compass direction should have one name only and should have the same name throughout its entire length in the Municipality and, if possible, in adjoining municipalities. <br><br>In particular, the following standards shall be applied: <br><br>(1) Road names shall:(a) be easy to pronounce; <br><br>(b) be comprised of recognizable words or acceptable combination of words; <br><br>(c) be easy to spell for a person of intermediate reading level; <br><br>(d) take into account any long standing local usage of names or words used in the name; <br><br>(e) be in good taste; and <br><br>(f) contain only those special characters which can be electronically recorded and manipulated with ease using varying conventional software, and shall exclude stylized symbols.(2) Qualifying words such as Upper, Lower, New, Old, etc., should be avoided unless the qualifying word has been applied in some other official context (for example as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer).(3) <br><br>All names must have an associated road type and the road type must conform with the road type criteria in the attached Road and Street Type Schedule, but existing Mon-conforming road types may be continued to avoid the cost, confusion and disturbance of changing only a road type.(4) Road and street names should be alpha-numeric and name submissions using a numeric should be rejected: for example, ""First Street"" would be acceptable, but <br><br>""¡S Street"" should not be accepted.(5) Where a new road or street is a continuation of an existing road, wherever possible the new road or street will be given the same name as the existing road or street.There will be no duplication of road or street names within the Municipality and, + if possible, duplication of names with names used in immediately adjoining municipal unites should be avoided.(7) Road and street names, including abbreviated road and street type, shall have no more than 35 characters.(8) If the road or street is named after a topographic feature or location, the name should reflect the official name as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer.A personal name (a combination of given name and surname) should not be applied to a municipal street or provincial road unless such application is in the public interest. The person commemorated should have contributed significantly in the area in which the road is located. The adoption of a personal name during the lifetime of the person concerned should only be made in exceptional circumstances. Formal titles of distinction, such as Captain, Major, Admiral, etc., should be avoided.(10 A name that is intended to be commemorative of a person or event must be <br><br>historically accurate. A person or group proposing a commemorative name must submit to the Civic Addressing Coordinator evidence or proof of the accuracy of the proposed name, and any interested person or group may submit evidence or proof to the contrary. <br><br>(11) Company or commercial product names and names associated with copyright or trademarks should be avoided.(12) Words should be spelled correctly.(13) Names with mixed language should be avoided except to the extent of always using an English road or street type.","When first naming roads and streets, the name should include a road type consistent with the following: <br><br>Abbey <br><br>Acres <br><br>Alley <br><br>Avenue <br><br>Bay <br><br>Beach <br><br>Bend <br><br>Bluff <br><br>Boulevard <br><br>Branch <br><br>Cape <br><br>Centre <br><br>Circle <br><br>Common <br><br>Connector <br><br>Corner <br><br>Court <br><br>Cove <br><br>Crescent <br><br>Crossing <br><br>Cul-De-Sac <br><br>Dale <br><br>Dell <br><br>DiversionDowns <br><br>Drive <br><br>End <br><br>Estate <br><br>Estates <br><br>Exit <br><br>Extension <br><br>Field <br><br>Forest <br><br>Garden <br><br>Gardens <br><br>Gate <br><br>Glade <br><br>Glen <br><br>Green <br><br>Grove <br><br>Haven <br><br>Heights <br><br>Highlands <br><br>Highway <br><br>Hollow <br><br>Island <br><br>Junction <br><br>KnollLanding <br><br>Lane <br><br>Limits <br><br>Link <br><br>Lookout <br><br>Loop <br><br>Manor <br><br>Meadow <br><br>Mews <br><br>Moor <br><br>North <br><br>Orchard <br><br>Parade <br><br>Park <br><br>Parkway <br><br>Pass <br><br>Passage <br><br>Path <br><br>Pathway <br><br>Place <br><br>Plaza <br><br>Quay <br><br>Ramp <br><br>RestRidge <br><br>Road <br><br>Route <br><br>Row <br><br>Run <br><br>South <br><br>South Bound <br><br>Spur <br><br>Street <br><br>Subdivision <br><br>Terrace <br><br>Thicket <br><br>Trail <br><br>Trunk <br><br>Turnabout <br><br>Vista <br><br>Walk <br><br>Water Access <br><br>Way <br><br>West <br><br>Wharf",Have not heard back about email list,45.750076,-64.166034

Citizens of London contribute to this campaign for numerous reasons including being recognized through receiving appreciation from the City and/or having their name located on a plaque board or on a particular feature of the building or park. Donations made for a building campaign are usually collected by a community group toward the project. <br><br>The names of the Mayor, the appropriate Standing Committee of Council and Ward Councillors may be noted on a recognition plaque when the names are those of the Council which approved the project. <br><br>b) A Civic Recognition <br><br>A civic recognition may be requested by a member of the public or may be initiated by the City itself to recognize a group or an individual’s outstanding accomplishments, involvement or work in the local community or in a provincial or national forum. <br><br>c) International, National or Provincial Events/Competitions <br><br>A naming or re-naming of a building or an amenity within it in recognition of it being a venue for international, national or provincial events/competitions will occur to fulfill a condition agreed to by the City as part of its hosting obligations.

It applies to all business relationships between The Corporation of the City of London and businesses which contribute either financially or in-kind to City programs, services or facilities in return for recognition, public acknowledgement or other promotional considerations. Only for cases of sponsorship which have an associated sunset clause, will a corporate name or advertising brand be used. <br><br>4.5 Types of Naming Situations Not Covered by This Policy <br><br>The following situations are not covered by this policy: <br><br>a) the recognition of fallen Fire Fighters and Fire Stations;  <br><br>b) Individual naming dedications made to a person to celebrate a special occasion such as: <br><br>i) a birth; <br><br>ii) a marriage; <br><br>iii) an anniversary; <br><br>iv) an accomplishment;  <br><br>v) a major landmark event, person(s) such as a retirement or happenings. <br><br>Options for individual naming dedications can be found for naming of park features covered under The Commemorative Park Bench and Tree Program and The Storybook Gardens Brick Naming Program.

As an example, contests for naming are considered as a special circumstance requiring approval by the appropriate Standing Committee of Council. <br><br>4.8 Civic Renaming <br><br>The City of London believes that existing names have a historical significance and place within the community and should not be changed unless it is an exceptional situation and it can be proven that the majority of the local community is in support of the change. Each application for re-naming will be examined on a case by case basis, and the following considerations shall apply: <br><br>a) Priority for re-naming will be granted by City Council in instances where a re-naming is a condition of the awarding of an International, National or Provincial Event/Competition and/or the duration of time agreed upon as part of this condition has expired. <br><br>b) Civic names may be changed if there are specific circumstances that arise which warrant a review. <br><br>c) The re-naming of an entire building or property could include: <br><br>i) adding another new name to the existing name; or, <br><br>ii) subdividing or portioning off a particular property or feature to be given a new name or sub name; or, <br><br>iii) placing the names of an organization (or individuals) on a plaque to recognize their contributions if it is found that it is inappropriate to name a particular property or building in its entirety. <br><br>4.9  Corporate Sponsorship Naming/Renaming <br><br>In addition to the general civic renaming considerations noted in part 4.8, above, corporate sponsorship naming/renaming initiatives shall: <br><br>a) have a specific sunset clause associated with the length of time that the corporate name will be used, with no guarantee of perpetuity; <br><br>b) consider the significance of the contribution made relative to the construction and operating cost of the property that is the subject of the naming; <br><br>c) require the sponsor to pay for the signage, unless the City has requested the name change;  <br><br>d) not be limited to this policy in those circumstances where there are more appropriate ways of recognizing a sponsorship, such as internal facility naming, the dedication of plaques at a facility such as the use of donor plaque boards, or the purchase of park features such as trees, benches and picnic tables",N/A,mayor@london.ca,43.083889,-81.298611

ontario_welland,,record,Welland,Ontario,Yes,"Commemorative Street Naming: Policy Statement: Commemorative Street Naming refers to the naming of a street to provide recognition, based upon historical content, community involvement or other significant contribution by providing commemorative street name signage while still retaining the legal street name.

Names given to municipal facilities, parks, properties, features and other amenities in the City of Welland will cease through the expiration of the life cycle of the above-mentioned entity, unless a renaming initiative is commenced and approved in accordance with the requirements of this policy. In such cases, the renaming, when approved, will cease at the expiration of the life cycle of the entity. The application of this policy includes four main types of naming situations: • the opening of a new municipal facility, park, property or feature. • the re-opening of a municipal facility, park, property or feature following renovation or refurbishment. • the renaming of an existing facility, park, property or feature to recognize significant contributions that organizations or individuals have made to the public and well-being of the City of Welland. • providing recognition of gifts generously given or donated to the City. This policy is not intended to address naming situations related to sponsorships or naming rights sold, usually for a specific term, as part of a naming partnership involving agreements normally comprised of a variety of benefits and opportunities for both the sponsor and the municipality. <br><br>NAMING CRITERIA AND GUIDELINES All proposed names for any municipal facilities, property, features and amenities shall conform to the majority of the following guidelines; •	 Names should give a sense of place, continuity, belonging and celebrate distinguishing characteristics and uniqueness of Welland. •	 Names should maintain a long-standing local area identification with residents of Welland. •	 Names should be consistent with any other applicable City of Welland policies and standards •	 Names which reflect and/or imply a reference to any of the following WILL NOT be eligible; names of living individuals unless by exception approved by Council or as a result of a significant financial contribution made by a donor; political affiliation; derogatory or offensive terms or references; discrimination against race, gender, ethnicity, or creed; duplication; tobacco or alcoholic products; names considered inappropriate for a civic amenity or inconsistent with the Corporate Strategic Directions and/or Vision for the City. In addition to the previously mentioned restrictions and guidelines, the City of Welland has three accepted categories for the selection of names for municipal facilities, properties, features and amenities. The three accepted categories do not apply to naming requests acknowledging significant financial gifts. The three accepted categories are geographic, historic and prominent individuals and/or organizations. GEOGRAPHIC - Names having a geographical affiliation, which may include but are not limited to the following references; •	 a neighborhood, community, or subdivision . •	 an adjacent street •	 a noteworthy physical, environmental or scenic quality •	 an unique site characteristic or scenic quality •	 proximity to a recognized facility or area •	 topographical or ecological characteristics HISTORIC - Names having a historical affiliation, which may include but are not limited to the following references; •	 a local or national historical event •	 a heritage event PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS AND/OR ORGANIZATIONS - Names affiliated with individuals and/or organizations, the following criteria will be used to weigh the suitability of the name being proposed; •	 individuals or families having a historical connection to the site (such as a previous landowner) •	 individuals and/or organizations having a significant contribution to the community/City in one or more of the following areas; 1) Service as an elected representative to the municipal, provincial or federal government for at least two terms 2) Service as a member of a public board, committee or commission 3) Service in a voluntary capacity in community organizations such as service clubs, cultural groups, unions, ethnic organizations, community associations, professional organizations, etc. 4) Service in a voluntary or philanthropic capacity or having made a significant contribution in the areas of agriculture, arts and culture, co-operatives, education, business or industry, journalism, medicine, politics, religion, science, public service, recreation or sports on a local, provincial, national or international scale. In those cases where names are affiliated with individuals and/or organizations, the following criteria must be met; •	 The contributions of the individual and/or organization must be well documented and broadly acknowledged within the community •	 To the extent where possible, a direct relationship should exist between the individual and/or organization and the amenity being considered for naming/renaming. •	 The reputation of the individual and/or organization must be honorable, as the term implies, to be considered for naming/renaming. •	 Where an amenity is to be named/renamed after someone who is deceased, permission and agreement must be obtained from the next of kin or legal representative involved prior to consideration and review by the City. Where the names of deceased individuals are being considered, a five year waiting period after the death of the individual must be observed before considering the name for commemoration in naming such amenity. The rationale for this is to ensure that amenities are not precipitously named/renamed in the initial emotional outpourings after the death of a public figure or prominent individual. The names of living persons shall not be permitted unless used in the recognition of a significant financial contribution or by exception approved by Council. DONOR RECOGNITION - SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL GIFTS The City of Welland will consider naming a public amenity as a means of providing recognition for significant financial gifts to the City, in accordance with this and other applicable city policies. The guidelines under the NAMING CRITERIA - GENERAL GUIDELINES section will apply. The term ""SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL GIFT"" implies a minimum monetary donation of 35% of the total real or capital cost or appraised value, whichever is greater, of the amenity being considered for naming/renaming. The names of living individuals may be used in recognition of significant financial gifts. The City of Welland reserves the right to immediately withdraw a name from an amenity should that name come into disrepute in the City or in the general community. RENAMING OF EXISTING MUNICIPAL AMENITIES Recognizing that established names contribute significantly to community identity and pride, proposals to rename existing municipal amenities must be predicated by exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, existing names will not be changed without the considering the historical significance of the existing name; the impact on the individual and/or organization associated with the existing name or; the cost and impact of changing the existing signage, rebuilding community recognition and updating records (data bases, letterhead, promotional materials, etc.). All renaming requests must be submitted in the same format as listed in the section SUBMISSION PROCESS. Where a name/renaming change is recommended, a communication strategy will be initiated by advertising the proposed change on the City’s website and Civic Corner for a period of 30 days during which time, public comments will be received and considered. Additionally, the costs associated with the naming/renaming initiative will be the responsibility of the City when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the City and will be the responsibility of the individual and/or organization when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the individual and/or organization.

Ex. : Les locutions « rang du Précieux-Sang » et « Bac-passeur » qui se réfèrent respectivement à la 1re Rue Est au-delà du secteur des écoles et à la structure qui reliait les deux rives de l’Harricana avant la construction du pont Desmarais, existent dans la tradition orale amossoise, mais n’ont jamais été officialisés dans la toponymie municipale. - Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. - Langue de l’élément spécifique Les noms communs composant de nouveaux toponymes sont en français. Il est possible de conserver la langue d’origine d’un nom commun s’il a une valeur culturelle ou historique. - Présence et unicité du générique Le nom d’une voie de communication, d’un parc public, d’un édifice ou d’une autre construction comporte toujours un générique. - Utilisation de génériques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de l’Office québécois de la langue française). - Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. - Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel est utilisé pour composer un autre toponyme, il doit en respecter la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques. Ex. : Le nom officiel « Lac Beauchamp » est repris de façon intégrale dans le nom « chemin du Lac-Beauchamp ».",N/A,luce.cardinal@amos.quebec,48.566667,-78.116667

quebec_farnham,,record,Farnham,Quebec,Yes,"Critères de choix toponymiques de la Ville Unicité du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou entité géographique ne se voit attribuer qu’un seul nom officiel. Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils ne dérogent pas à d’autres critères. Dans les cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. Toutefois, en ce qui concerne les entités naturelles, la langue du générique peut ne pas être française si l’importance du lieu désigné est locale et si le nom de ce lieu est en usage exclusivement dans cette langue autre que française. Langue de l’élément spécifique Sauf exception justifiable, il est de règle de conserver dans leur langue les mots de la langue générale qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. On officialise dans leur langue d’origine les spécifiques des toponymes amérindiens et inuits. Pour leur part, les points cardinaux inclus dans les odonymes et qui renseignent sur l’identité d’un tronçon par rapport à un autre ou sur la direction de la voie sont en français. Dans les cas d’usages concurrents d’une forme française et d’une forme dans une autre langue, le Comité privilégie la première si l’usage local en est significatif. Par ailleurs, les mots de la langue générale qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes créés par le Comité sont en français. Présence et unité du générique Un nom d’entité naturelle ou artificielle comporte habituellement un générique. Un odonyme en comprend toujours un. Un nom d’entité administrative peut en comporter lorsque le lieu désigné n’est pas une Ville, un autre lieu habité ou un lieu-dit. Cependant, un nom géographique ne peut comprendre plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction d’un générique. Utilisation de génériques conformes Les noms d’entités administratives et les noms nouveaux de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques. Les génériques des noms attribués à des entités naturelles innommées peuvent être différents des termes consacrés par les avis terminologiques dans une volonté de promotion de la langue française du Québec en tant qu’élément du patrimoine, de renforcement de l’image suggérée par le lieu lui-même, de meilleure intégration du toponyme créé aux éléments génériques présents dans le milieu ou encore afin de respecter un usage historique. Noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an Un lieu peut se voir attribuer un nom commémoratif d’après celui d’une personne vivante et ayant une importance historique certaine ou un lien étroit avec le lieu à désigner. Seuls les noms de personnes décédées depuis plus d’un an peuvent faire l’objet d'une officialisation auprès de la Commission de Toponymie du Québec. Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte intégralement la forme. Utilisation d’un nom de rue en lien avec le lieu à commémorer Certains noms facilitent le ""repérage"" de lieux par les citoyens et les visiteurs. Lorsque possible, le Comité doit s’assurer, lors de l’utilisation d’un nom, qu’il existe un lien certain entre ce nom et son environnement immédiat. Utilisation du mot ""Famille"" dans la dénomination La Ville n’est pas favorable à l’utilisation du mot ""Famille"" dans la graphie d’un nom. Utilisation de plusieurs prénoms pour un même nom de famille La Ville n'est pas favorable à l'utilisation d'un nom de famille avec divers prénoms. Utilisation du nom de fille d’une femme mariée L’utilisation pour une commémoration du nom de fille d’une femme mariée demeure une approche répandue. Dans cette démarche les personnes honorées ne sont pas très connues ou seulement localement. Toutefois, lorsque certaines femmes sont de notoriété reconnue et utilisent le nom de famille de leur mari, c’est cette désignation qui devrait généralement être retenue. Similitude quant à l’écriture et la prononciation Lors de la fusion municipale de mars 2000, il avait été souligné le problème de la coexistence de noms identiques ou présentant des similitudes quant à l’écriture et la prononciation, ce qui aurait pu engendrer des risques d’erreurs et porter atteinte à la sécurité de la population. Encore aujourd’hui, le choix de nouvelles dénominations doit tenir compte de ce facteur. Utilisation de l’initiale La Ville n’est pas favorable à l’utilisation de l’initiale du prénom d’un personnage à commémorer. Voie de circulation limitrophe entre deux zones résidentielles Une voie de circulation, qui divise deux zones résidentielles limitrophes dont les thématiques sont différentes, peut recevoir un nom sans lien direct avec l'une ou l'autre des deux thématiques. Impartialité de la Ville D’un point de vue toponymique, la Ville doit demeurer impartiale face aux organismes militants, qu’il s’agisse de groupes religieux, politiques ou autres. En tant que corps municipal au service de tous les citoyens, la Ville doit faire preuve de neutralité pour ne pas donner l’impression qu’elle privilégie un groupe au détriment d’un autre, ni n’endosse de positions politiques ou religieuses défendues par des groupes d’intérêt. Nombre de commémoration pour une personne De façon générale, la Ville honore une seule fois une même personne. Il peut arriver que seul le nom de famille soit utilisé pour honorer cette personne. Dans ce cas, le nom au complet ne pourrait être repris, car la commémoration existe déjà.",Appplication form: https://www.ville.farnham.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Politique-de-denomination-toponymique.pdf,alevesque@ville.farnham.qc.ca,45.283333,-72.983333

Les lieux à nommer sont : - Les voies de communication publiques ou privées (rues, chemins, etc.); - Les parcs et espaces verts publics; - Les édifices publics et les salles publiques à l’intérieur de ces édifices; - Les équipements sportifs ou culturels publics; - Tous les autres lieux ou espaces publics. 5. PROCÉDURE DE DÉNOMINATION TOPONYMIQUE 5.1 Dépôt d’une demande de dénomination toponymique Une demande de dénomination toponymique peut notamment être présentée par un citoyen, un groupe de personnes ou un organisme ou être initiée par les différentes instances de la Ville de Bromont. Le requérant a la responsabilité de fournir toutes les informations relatives au toponyme proposé nécessaire à l’analyse de sa demande de dénomination toponymique. 5.2 Analyse et recommandation du Comité de toponymie Le Comité de toponymie analyse la demande de dénomination toponymique soumise en fonction des critères d’analyse et de choix des noms des lieux établis dans la présente Politique et formule une recommandation par écrit au conseil municipal. À noter que dans le cas d’une recommandation favorable, le Comité de toponymie demande préalablement un avis technique à la Commission de toponymie, afin de s’assurer du respect des règles d’écriture établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec. 5.3 Décision du conseil municipal Le conseil municipal reçoit et analyse la recommandation du Comité de toponymie (en fonction des critères d’analyse et de choix des noms des lieux établis dans la présente Politique). Par la suite, le conseil municipal adopte une résolution par laquelle ce dernier accepte ou refuse la demande de dénomination toponymique. 5.4 Suivi des décisions du conseil municipal Dans le cas d’un refus de la demande de dénomination toponymique par le conseil municipal, le Comité de toponymie en informe le requérant et ferme la demande de dénomination toponymique. Dans le cas d’une acceptation de la demande de dénomination toponymique par le conseil municipal, le Comité de toponymie transmet la résolution (et tout autre document jugé nécessaire et pertinent à la demande) à la Commission de toponymie du Québec en vue de demander l’officialisation du toponyme auprès de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. 5.5 Liste des noms de lieux En tout temps, le Comité de toponymie s’assure de gérer et de tenir à jour une banque de noms pour de futures dénominations toponymiques. <br><br>6. CRITÈRES D’ANALYSE L’analyse du choix des noms des lieux se fait selon les critères suivants : Normes générales 1. Unicité du nom de lieu : Tout lieu se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel; 2. Usage : Les toponymes dont l’usage populaire est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils ne dérogent pas à d’autres critères. Dans le cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères; 3. Langue de l’élément générique : L’élément générique est en français; 4. Langue de l’élément spécifique : Les mots de la langue générale qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes sont en français.Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots d’une langue autre que le français qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visés par cette règle et sont écrits dans leur forme originale. Les points cardinaux inclus dans les noms de voies de communication (odonymes) qui renseignent sur la localisation d’un tronçon par rapport à un autre ou sur la direction de la voie sont en français; 5. Présence et unicité du générique : Un nom d’entité naturelle ou artificielle comporte habituellement un générique. Un odonyme comporte toujours un générique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction de générique; 6. Utilisation de génériques conformes : Les lieux et odonymes doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de l’Office québécois de la langue française); 7. Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an : Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. Le nom proposé rend hommage à une personnalité qui a apporté une contribution significative au développement, au dynamisme ou au bien-être de la communauté de la Ville de Bromont; 8. Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel : Lorsqu’on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques; <br><br>Sources inspirantes recommandées 9. Ressources historiques et folkloriques du milieu : Pour la désignation de lieux, il convient de s’inspirer des faits des événements et des personnages historiques ou folkloriques qui ont marqué la vie locale ou régionale; 10. Ressources de la géographie : La dénomination de lieux tire avantage de s’inspirer des caractéristiques du milieu naturel environnant (flore, faune, géologie, etc.); 11. Préservation des régionalismes : Il importe d’accorder un soin particulier à la préservation des régionalismes dans la toponymie; 12. Désignations commémoratives : Des personnes, des organismes, des collectivités ou des événements peuvent faire l’objet de désignations commémoratives s’ils ont joué un rôle important pour la communauté québécoise; 13. Noms de personnes : Lorsqu’on honore la mémoire d’une personne par l’attribution de son nom à un lieu, on devrait privilégier le nom sous lequel elle est la mieux connue; il peut s’agir d’un nom complet ou d’une forme usuelle. Le choix de l’anthroponyme commémoratif doit permettre d’identifier correctement la personne honorée. On s’efforce généralement de retenir le nom complet de la personne (prénom(s) et nom de famille); <br><br>Pratiques contre-indiquées 14. Désignations péjoratives, grossières ou suscitant la dissension : On doit éviter l’emploi de noms à connotation péjorative ou grossière, de même que les choix susceptibles de provoquer ou d’alimenter une dissension; 15. Noms banals ou utilisés fréquemment : On doit éviter l’emploi de noms trop banals et ceux dont l’existence est largement répandue. Certains noms servent à désigner un grand nombre d’entités géographiques différentes et leur répétition peut être source de confusion. Dans toute recherche en vue de l’attribution d’un nom à un lieu innommé, il convient de s’inspirer davantage des données historiques locales et des différentes particularités morphologiques, biologiques ou autres du milieu en faisant preuve d’originalité, afin d’éviter d’ajouter à la prolifération de noms fréquemment utilisés et rendus banals; 16. Désignations publicitaires : On doit éviter d’attribuer des noms qui peuvent servir de réclame à des marques de commerce ou à des entreprises commerciales ou industrielles; 17. Désignations numériques, alphabétiques et alphanumériques : Il faut éviter d’utiliser des nombres et des lettres comme base de dénomination des lieux. Cependant, le cas échéant, il convient d’utiliser la forme ordinale (l’adjectif numéral) plutôt que la forme cardinale (le nombre pur); 18. Points cardinaux : L’utilisation de points cardinaux est à éviter, à moins qu’ils ne désignent de façon précise une entité ou qu’ils ne fassent partie d’un toponyme existant. Pour former de nouveaux toponymes, on peut bien sûr utiliser des toponymes qui en comportent déjà; 19. Juxtaposition de toponymes : On devrait éviter de créer des toponymes en juxtaposant des spécifiques toponymiques ou des toponymes entiers si cela est de nature à produire des noms géographiques dont la longueur rend leur utilisation difficile; <br><br>Autres : 20. Doublon et homonyme : Deux lieux ne doivent pas porter le même nom ni un nom semblable, dans le but d’éviter la redondance et le risque de confusion engendrés par l’existence de doublons et d’homonymes, à l’exception des lieux contigus; 21. Ambiguïté : Toute ambiguïté dans la dénomination doit être évitée afin d’assurer la sécurité reliée à la recherche d’une adresse civique pour les services d’urgence (ambulancier, policier, pompier, etc.); 22. Remplacement d’un nom par un autre : Dans le cas où se présente une suggestion de remplacement d’un nom par un autre, le statu quo doit être privilégié, à moins qu’une démonstration claire ne soit faite indiquant que le changement comporte de grands avantages, qu’il est sans préjudice pour autrui et qu’il a une valeur patrimoniale ou historique; 23. Caractère logique de la dénomination : Il existe un lien pertinent entre le toponyme proposé et le lieu à nommer. Dans le cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronçons devraient autant que possible porter le nom des tronçons existants; 24. Sentiment d’appartenance : Le nom proposé est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment d’appartenance à la Ville de Bromont. Il met en valeur l’identité bromontoise, le patrimoine et l’histoire locale les lieux d’appartenance; 25. Représentativité des femmes : Le nom proposé vise à améliorer la représentativité des femmes dans la toponymie bromontoise, en tenant notamment compte de l’importance et de la superficie du lieu nommé; 26. Thématique : Le choix ou le maintien d’une thématique spécifique est favorisé pour un secteur ou partie de secteur dans la dénomination des nouvelles rues et des parcs et espaces verts. 27. Règles d’écriture : Les règles d’écriture établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec doivent être respectées;",N/A,ville@bromont.com,45.316667,-72.65

Parks and green spaces <br><br>Specific eligibility conditions: <br><br>The municipal council may name or rename its parks and green spaces: <br><br>4.1. In honor of a person: <br><br>Having stood out on the local scene by carrying out a major project or defending a cause that is particularly important to the community; <br><br>Having been deceased for at least two years. <br><br>4.2. In memory of an event that will have greatly marked the community. <br><br>In the case of certain parks or spaces whose name is associated with local organizations, any changes must be made in collaboration with the organizations concerned. <br><br>The City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will allow citizens at any time to submit nominations to honor new personalities based on the criteria of this category. <br><br>Process and general eligibility <br><br>The program has five categories for which criteria are defined. <br><br>1. Enhancement of current names <br>2. New developments <br>3. Naming of public buildings and major infrastructures <br>4. Parks and green spaces <br>5. Forecourt of starry blueberries <br><br>In all cases, it is the municipal council that makes the decision to rename a building, an infrastructure, a green space or any other place under its jurisdiction. The latter may consult the community and, when applicable, must formalize its procedures with the Commission de toponymie du Québec. As soon as it is adopted in 2017, the City will provide citizens with web forms to suggest the candidacy of new personalities for categories 4 and 5. <br><br>With regard to categories 3, 4 and 5, each toponymic recognition or commemoration action will be accompanied by a civic reception and the signing of the City's guestbook. In addition, the City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will take steps to allow citizens to have access to the biography of the personalities thus honored, in particular by posting them in the Bank of Place Names of Québec, on the site of the Commission de toponymie. <br><br>General eligibility requirements: <br><br>To be eligible for any category of this program, a person must be considered a Dolmissoise or a Dolmissois.

The first category of this program will consist of highlighting current odonyms, thanks to the collaboration of the Maria-Chapdelaine History and Genealogy Society. <br><br>The City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will therefore take the following measures: <br><br>Formalize the origin of the names of thoroughfares with the Commission de toponymie du Québec and ensure their distribution in the Bank of place names of Québec. <br><br>Allow the History and Genealogy Society to publish and sell a guide listing all the odonyms of the city of Dolbeau-Mistassini. <br><br>To consult the list of official toponyms in Dolbeau-Mistassini, consult the website of the Commission de toponymie du Québec .  <br><br>2. New developments <br><br>When the previously developed urban planning logic allows it, the choice of street names for new developments gives preponderance to the pioneers of Dolbeau-Mistassini who contributed in its beginnings to founding the former towns of Dolbeau and Mistassini, and this , more precisely between 1892 and 1950. The toponymic proposals provided by the Maria-Chapdelaine Historical and Genealogical Society are mainly used as a reference for this category. <br><br>3.

quebec_coaticook,,record,Coaticook,Quebec,Yes,"1.2 Objectifs La présente politique vise à :  Mettre en valeur l’histoire et le patrimoine de la Ville de Coaticook par la dénomination de ses rues, de ses routes, de ses chemins, de ses bâtiments, de ses lieux et de toute autre entité géographique;  Éliminer toute ambiguïté dans la dénomination afin d’assurer la sécurité reliée à la recherche d’une adresse civique pour divers services (ambulancier, policier, incendie, etc.).  Développer le sentiment d’appartenance des citoyens par la dénomination;  Établir une démarche respectueuse avant de procéder à une dénomination. <br><br>4.0 PROCÉDURE Toute requête de dénomination reçue par la Ville de Coaticook est acheminée au comité de toponymie. Le comité de toponymie analyse la demande et transmet, au besoin, sa recommandation au conseil municipal. Dans le cas d’une décision favorable par ce dernier, la résolution est transmise à la Commission de toponymie du Québec, qui officialise la nomination. Celle-ci entre en vigueur lors de la réception d’une réponse d’officialisation de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. La Ville achemine alors l’information aux services concernés (urbanisme, travaux publics, communication, culture, Poste Canada) Si la proposition ne peut être attribuée à court terme, elle est alors insérée à la banque de noms. 5.0 RÈGLES DE DÉNOMINATION Avant de choisir un nom pour un lieu donné, les aspects suivants sont examinés :  La nature du lieu : voie, parc, place publique ou immeuble;  les qualités du lieu à nommer : sa fonction, sa localisation géographique et son contexte, qu’il soit résidentiel, commercial, industriel ou culturel;  l’histoire du quartier sur les plans urbain et social;  la toponymie existante : afin d’éviter les doublons ou homonymes, et d’harmoniser les nouvelles désignations avec le patrimoine toponymique du secteur;  le profil biographique de la personne dont la mémoire est honorée;  l’importance de certains événements et leur impact social;  l’association naturelle entre la personne, la communauté résidante concernée et le lieu à nommer 5.1 Critères fondamentaux La politique de désignation toponymique et odonymique doit permettre d’identifier le meilleur choix de toponymes en s’appuyant sur certains critères fondamentaux soit :  Éviter les dénominations dépourvues de tout contenu culturel ;  Tenir compte du contenu enrichissant qu’offre les noms issus de l’histoire et du patrimoine local ou national ;  Éviter le choix d’un nom dont l’attribution pourrait provoquer une controverse ;  Éviter les noms à consonance semblable (homonyme) ou doublons qui pourrait confondre le repérage par les services d’urgence ;  Faciliter le repérage du lieu nommé ;  Honorer une seule fois une même personne ;  Exclure les noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an ;  Attribuer un seul nom officiel à tout lieu ou entité géographique. <br><br>5.2 Critères spécifiques Pour la dénomination des voies de communication (rue, chemin, sentiers) ainsi que des édifices municipaux, places publiques ou monuments, il est important que l’attribution d’un nom soit représentative du milieu historique, culturel ou communautaire. Ainsi, il est recommandé de fixer le choix sur les critères suivants :  Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particulièrement illustrées au sein de leur communauté ;  Favoriser le nom des pionniers qui ont bâti la municipalité ;  Favoriser le nom de l’ancêtre d’une famille ancienne ;  Favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement de la ville ;  Éviter la nomination désignant seulement la fonction de l’édifice. Pour la désignation des parcs et espaces verts municipaux, dont les principaux utilisateurs sont les gens du milieu environnant, il convient de suivre les critères suivants:  Premièrement, donner le nom de la rue adjacente au parc pour permettre un meilleure repérage de celui-ci par les usagers ;  Deuxièmement, favoriser le nom de l’ancêtre d’une famille ancienne ayant habité dans le secteur concerné ou ;  Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particulièrement illustrées au sein de leur communauté dans le secteur visé, ou dans la municipalité.",N/A,s.lavertu@coaticook.ca,45.133333,-71.8
quebec_gaspe,,record,Gaspé,Quebec,Yes,"La présente politique vise à : ✓ Mettre en valeur l’histoire et le patrimoine de la Ville de Gaspé par la dénomination de ses rues, de ses routes, de ses chemins, de ses bâtiments, de ses lieux et de toute autre entité géographique; ✓ Formaliser une démarche claire et respectueuse où les citoyens sont impliqués; ✓ Établir une liste officielle des lieux nommés et officialiser légalement leur dénomination auprès de la Commission de la toponymie du Québec et des autres services d’urgence et gouvernementaux. <br><br>La Commission de toponymie est l’organisme responsable de la gestion des noms de lieux du Québec. MISSION S’assurer que le territoire du Québec est nommé avec justesse et qu’il met en valeur le visage français du Québec. MANDAT Créée en 1977 en vertu de la Charte de la langue française, la Commission doit : • proposer au gouvernement les normes et les règles d’écriture à respecter dans la dénomination des lieux; • procéder à l’inventaire et à la conservation des noms de lieux; • établir et normaliser la terminologie géographique, en collaboration avec l’Office québécois de la langue française; • officialiser les noms de lieux; • diffuser la nomenclature géographique officielle du Québec; • donner son avis au gouvernement sur toute question que celui-ci lui soumet en matière de toponymie. <br><br>Le rôle du comité consultatif d'urbanisme de la Ville de Gaspé est notamment : • de faire des recommandations au conseil municipal en matière d’urbanisme et d’aménagement du territoire (mission première); • d’offrir à la communauté un accès à des outils de gestion cohérents (plan d’implantation et d’intégration architecturale, dérogation mineure, etc.); • de donner place à l’innovation et à l’originalité; • de permettre une diversité des points de vue et accroître la participation des citoyens; • de collaborer à la protection des paysages, à l’harmonisation des utilisations du sol, éviter les incompatibilités d’usage, etc. Il est important de noter que le comité consultatif d'urbanisme est un comité aviseur auprès du conseil municipal; l’acceptation ou le refus d’un projet demeure du ressort exclusif des élus municipaux. Le comité consultatif d'urbanisme de la Ville de Gaspé est formé de deux élus municipaux et de sept membres non élus choisis dans la communauté et provenant de secteurs géographiques, sociaux, économiques différents et complémentaires. De plus, certaines personnes ressources assistent le comité dans leurs travaux (directeur de l’Urbanisme, inspecteurs, aménagiste, etc.). Le comité consultatif d’urbanisme, en collaboration avec la direction de l’Urbanisme de la Ville de Gaspé, est responsable de l’application de la politique de dénomination toponymique de la Ville de Gaspé et du comité de toponymie. <br><br>5.1 CRITÈRES GÉNÉRAUX • Tenir compte de la nature du lieu et de son utilisation (place publique, route, immeuble, etc.); • Tenir compte de l’histoire du secteur géographique ou du quartier où est situé le lieu; • Attribuer un seul nom officiel à un endroit; • Éviter les controverses; • Éviter les doublons ou homonymes. Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne : • Tenir compte de son lien avec le lieu choisi; • Tenir compte de sa biographie et de son implication; • Autant que possible, ne pas donner le nom à un endroit d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an; • Favoriser le nom de personnes s’étant particulièrement illustrées dans un domaine en particulier ou susceptibles d’avoir marqué l’histoire locale, régionale, nationale ou internationale; • S’assurer que cette personne ne possède pas d’antécédents criminels pouvant compromettre sa réputation. Lorsqu’il s’agit d’un nom commun : • Tenir compte des éléments géographiques et topographiques à proximité du lieu; • Privilégier les noms pouvant servir à repérer plus facilement l’endroit. Lorsqu’un nouveau développement résidentiel se présente, le comité de toponymie devrait privilégier un thème commun pour la désignation des nouvelles rues. <br><br>5.2 REMPLACEMENT D’UN NOM PAR UN AUTRE Dans le cas où se présenterait une suggestion de remplacement d’un nom par un autre, le statu quo devrait être privilégié, à moins qu’une démonstration claire ne soit présentée au comité de toponymie à l’effet que le changement comporte de grands avantages, sans préjudice pour autrui. Le remplacement d’un nom commun par un nom propre sera privilégié plutôt que l’inverse. <br><br>5.3 POSSIBILITÉ DE DONNER UN NOM D’UN ORGANISME, ENTREPRISE OU PERSONNE PRIVÉE AYANT CONTRIBUÉ FINANCIÈREMENT AU PROJET La Ville de Gaspé se réserve le droit de négocier avec des organismes, entreprises ou personnes privées qui pourraient contribuer financièrement soit à la construction d’une infrastructure ou au maintien des activités d’un lieu et qui aimeraient donner leur nom à ce lieu en échange. Dans ce cas, le conseil municipal sera le seul responsable du choix de ce nom.",N/A,marc.dupont@ville.gaspe.qc.ca,48.780556,-64.488611

quebec_carleton-sur-mer,,record,Carleton-sur-Mer,Quebec,Yes,"1. Contexte et fondements <br><br>À la suite de la fusion de la Ville de Carleton avec la municipalité de Saint-Omer, la nouvelle entité, la ville de Carleton-sur-Mer, constate la nécessité de se doter d’une politique pour la dénomination de ses rues, de ses routes, de ses chemins, de ses bâtiments, de ses lieux et places publiques ou de toute autre entité géographique. <br><br>La Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer abrite une multitude de rues, de places publiques et d’édifices qui sont désignés par une appellation les différenciant les uns des autres. Ces différentes appellations portent le nom de toponyme, terme utilisé pour désigner les noms des entités géographiques de la municipalité. <br><br>La Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer est appelée à croître au cours des prochaines années. À cet effet, de nouveaux projets de construction résidentielle et commerciale verront le jour. De plus, la Ville reçoit régulièrement des demandes de citoyens qui désirent attribuer un nom à une entité qui n’en possède pas ou proposer des appellations pour des entités futures. Enfin, l’existence de plusieurs doublons dans les noms de rues est l’une des premières raisons qui motive la municipalité à revoir l’ensemble de la dénomination à l’intérieur d’une politique qui tient compte de ce qui caractérise le milieu. <br><br>Dans le but de pouvoir gérer efficacement l’ensemble du dossier toponymique, la Corporation de l’Écomusée Tracadièche et le directeur du développement culturel à la Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer ont élaboré la présente politique dont la mise en place est destinée à améliorer la méthodologie en matière de dénomination au sein de la municipalité. <br><br>5. Mandats du directeur du développement culturel et de l’Écomusée Tracadièche <br><br>· Formuler des avis toponymiques adressés aux instances concernées; <br><br>· Coordonner la gestion et la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles; <br><br>· Verser les appellations retenues dans la banque de noms disponibles et refuser les noms jugés invalides ; <br><br>· Coordonner les actions (recherche, etc.) nécessaires à la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles; <br><br>· Consulter la population en cas de besoin, en collaboration avec les instances municipales, pour obtenir des suggestions de toponymes et connaître les préférences des citoyens; <br><br>· Assurer le bon fonctionnement des prises de décisions en tenant à jour la documentation justifiant la prise de décisions. <br><br>6. Processus <br><br>6.1 Lorsqu’elle le juge nécessaire, la Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer entend nommer ses rues, ses routes, ses chemins, ses lieux et toute autre entité géographique de la façon suivante : <br><br>· En rendant un hommage posthume à un citoyen décédé depuis au moins un an et qui a grandement contribué, par son action, au développement du milieu et de la communauté; <br><br>· En rendant un hommage posthume à un personnage considéré comme un fondateur ou un pionnier; <br><br>· En utilisant un fait historique qui relate une période ou un événement en relation avec l’histoire de la communauté ou de la région; <br><br>· En utilisant un toponyme ou un paysage exclusif au milieu. <br><br>6.2 Le Conseil de Ville consulte son directeur du service culturel et l’Écomusée Tracadièche avant de procéder à une dénomination. <br><br>6.3 La proposition toponymique est effectuée par les membres de l’Écomusée Tracadièche et le directeur du développement culturel. Un dossier est ouvert pour chaque demande ou proposition. Dans tous les cas, la recommandation doit être accompagnée d’une argumentation justifiant le choix du nom. <br><br>6.4 La préparation d’un dossier accompagne chaque proposition. L’exercice consiste à rassembler le plus de documentation possible à propos du nom proposé. Ces renseignements serviront à justifier la proposition toponymique. Cette étape du processus de dénomination toponymique a pour but d’évaluer la valeur toponymique du nom proposé et d’en déterminer la validation à l'aide de critères précis. <br><br>6.5 Un rapport est rédigé puis déposé au conseil municipal.

ontario_meaford,,record,Meaford,Ontario,Yes,"Policy Statement The Municipality of Meaford has deemed it appropriate to establish a protocol for naming streets, parks and municipal facilities. The policy will ensure that naming opportunities are dealt with in a consistent manner. In this regard, the Street, Park and Municipal Facility Naming Policy establishes guidelines regarding naming and the establishment of an “Approved Name List”. Purpose This policy provides guidance on the method of street, park and municipal facility naming within the Municipality of Meaford. The function of naming is to enable people, and emergency services, to locate properties readily. This policy will be applied in conjunction with the civic numbering policy developed in conjunction with the County of Grey which utilizes a six digit number for rural properties and a three digit number for rural subdivisions. <br><br>Policy Requirements General Policies for Appropriate Names The following criteria will be considered for potential naming of streets, parks and facilities: Names Honouring Those Who Have Served or Given their Life in Public Service The Municipality will facilitate the naming of streets, parks and facilities after residents of the municipality who have lost their lives while serving within the Armed Forces. In addition, the Municipality may also include the name of those who lose their lives in the service of the public through either the Ontario Provincial Police or the Fire Department with the written consent of his/her immediate family. Special signage containing the Poppy symbol is to be used for all Veteran street, park and facility names. Names Honouring Individuals for Community Service, Local Historical Reasons, National Reasons or International Reasons Council may approve, upon request by an individual or proponent, a name for a street, park or facility which identifies a specific individual. Generally such a name will be of historic importance to the municipality or be a name which is of importance either nationally or internationally or lastly be a name of a person who has been of public service to the municipality or broader community. A written description of the individual’s contribution to the municipality, or broader community explaining why the honour should be given, shall be submitted by the proponent. Staff shall research names proposed by Council. The written consent of his/her immediate family is required. Names that reflect the Municipality’s Agricultural and/or Heritage/Nature Council may approve, or a proponent may request the approval of, a name which reflects the municipality’s agricultural and/or heritage/nature. A written description of the proposed name and its linkage to the area shall be submitted by the proponent. Staff shall research names proposed by Council. Other Names Other appropriate names are those that promote pride in the municipality, acknowledge local heritage and history, and recognize unique features and geography. Proposed names should meet one of following: • Commemorate local history, places, events, culture. • Strengthen neighbourhood identity to reflect the character of the area. • Recognize native wildlife, flora, fauna, natural features. • Recognize communities that contribute to the public life of the Municipality. • Names that represent specific themes are encouraged as they are easily recognizable for emergency services and provide consistency in large developments. Priority for Selection of Names In assigning names, names from the “Approved Name List” should be used when selecting names for a proposed street, park or facility. The categories of this list are as follows: 1. Names Honouring Those Who Have Served Their Country 2. Names Honouring Those who have given their Life in Public Service 3. Names Honouring Individuals – Local Historical 4. Names Honouring Individuals – National or International 5. Names Honouring Individuals – Community Service 6. Names that reflect the Municipality’s Agricultural and/or Recreational Heritage/Nature 7. Other Names Specific Policies regarding Suitability of Street Names When naming a new street, in addition to the General Policies as stated in the previous section, the following shall be adhered to ensure orderly naming of streets: Ease of Spelling and Pronunciation Street names shall be easily pronounced, recognized and use conventional spelling to avoid difficulties in emergency situations. Street names should be spelled the way they are pronounced. Individuals Streets named after individuals shall be a posthumously honour and Council shall consider such names provided that a written consent is obtained from the individual’s surviving immediate family. A written description is required detailing how the individual made a significant contribution to the Municipality of Meaford. The honouring of a living public figure requires his/her written consent. Two Word Street Names Proposed street names consisting of two words shall be changed to one word. Only a person’s last name shall be used unless additional identification is necessitated by the Municipality to prevent duplication with an existing street name in the municipality and surrounding local municipalities. Street Name Characteristics Names should generally not exceed ten characters in length. This helps ensure that the above mentioned criterion are met and that there is a standard street name signage across the municipality and county. Street Names to Avoid 1. Names that are in conflict with other street names within the Municipality or County of Grey. 2. Names that could be construed as advertising a particular business, product or brand. 3. Cumbersome, corrupted, modified names, discriminatory or derogatory names from the point of view of race, sex, colour, creed, political affiliation or other social factors. 4. Names with any sexual overtones, inappropriate humour, parody, slang or double meaning. 5. Names that have a secondary negative or offensive connotation. 6. Street names spelled differently but sound alike (i.e. Crosby Lane and Crosbie Lane) or have similar pronunciation but are spelled differently (i.e. Heirloom Street could be pronounced with ‘H’ dropped (Eirloom Street)). 7. Use of complex words (ex. Quetico Drive). 8. Names with hyphens, apostrophes or dashes are discouraged and only considered on a case by case basis provided other criterion is met.",Has an approved names list however there is nothing on it,mwiltonsiegel@meaford.ca,44.591111,-80.743333

quebec_boisbriand,,record,Boisbriand,Quebec,Yes,"Le premier rôle de la toponymie est de permettre le repérage géographique rapide et sécuritaire d’un lieu donné. C’est pourquoi l’attribution de noms aux lieux est encadré par des règles bien établies. Le second rôle de la toponymie est d’exprimer par des noms certains aspects de notre culture. À ce titre, la toponymie fait partie du patrimoine collectif. Le toponyme traduit une reconnaissance publique d’une cause, de la mémoire d’un personnage ou d’un événement. Ainsi, le toponyme anime le lieu et cristallise le sentiment d’appartenance à la collectivité. <br><br>Formuler des avis toponymiques  Obtenir tous les renseignements pertinents permettant une analyse et une décision éclairées;  Analyser, à la lumière des informations recueillies, toutes les demandes toponymiques qui lui sont soumises;  Formuler des avis toponymiques au conseil municipal lorsque requis. Le Comité de la toponymie et du patrimoine a un pouvoir de recommandation en ce qui a trait à l’attribution de noms;  Recommander au conseil municipal le nom de tous les nouveaux sites publics construits par la Ville, incluant rues, parcs, bâtiments, etc. Coordonner la gestion et la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles  Verser les appellations retenues dans la banque de noms disponibles et refuser les noms qui ne sont pas admissibles;  Coordonner les actions, recherches et ressources nécessaires à la bonification de la banque;  Suggérer des toponymes et/ou des thématiques lors de développement de nouvelles zones, lorsque requis;  Consulter la population, sur recommandation, afin d’obtenir des suggestions de toponymes et de connaître les préférences des citoyens. Assurer le bon fonctionnement du Comité  Tenir à jour toute la documentation justifiant les décisions du Comité. <br><br>Dépôt d’une requête  Toute personne qui dépose au Comité de la toponymie et du patrimoine une requête de dénomination doit remplir le formulaire de proposition toponymique (accessible en ligne ou à l’hôtel de ville). Le requérant a la responsabilité de procurer aux membres du Comité toute l’information relative au nom proposé et qui est nécessaire à l’analyse de sa demande.  Le Comité se réserve le droit de refuser ou de traiter toute demande pour laquelle un formulaire n’a pas été rempli ou dont le formulaire ne fournit pas suffisamment de renseignements.  Après le dépôt d’une requête, un accusé de réception est envoyé au requérant pour l’informer que sa demande sera traitée dans les meilleurs délais lors de la prochaine rencontre du Comité. Préparation du dossier  Un dossier est ouvert par le Comité pour chaque demande soumise.  Le Comité compile le plus de renseignements possible à propos du nom proposé. Ces renseignements serviront à l’analyse de la proposition. Analyse de la requête  L’analyse de la proposition toponymique est effectuée par les membres du Comité . À la suite de l’exercice, un rapport d’analyse est rédigé, puis versé au dossier de la demande.  Cette étape du processus de dénomination a pour but d’évaluer la valeur toponymiq <br><br>Critères d’analyse Dans son analyse, le Comité accorde une attention particulière aux critères suivants :  Conformité aux critères de choix de la Ville de Boisbriand (voir Annexe 1 – Extrait du Guide toponymique municipal de la Commission de toponymie du Québec) Le nom proposé est conforme aux critères de choix élaborés par la Ville selon les normes de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. En cas de conflit entre les critères de la Ville et ceux de la Commission, les critères de la Commission ont préséance.  Ancienneté du nom Le nom proposé a un caractère historique ou patrimonial; il fait notamment référence à une personne ou à un événement de notre histoire.  Caractère logique de la désignation Il existe un lien pertinent entre le nom proposé et le lieu à nommer dans le respect des thématiques existantes, s’il y a lieu. Dans les cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronçons devront porter le nom des tronçons existants.  Désignation commémorative Le nom proposé est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment d’appartenance à la ville. Il met en valeur l’identité boisbriannaise, les lieux d’appartenance, la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que le caractère francophone de la ville.  Doublon et homonyme Le nom proposé n’est ni un doublon ni un homonyme d’un lieu existant; aucune redondance ni aucun risque de confusion ne seront ainsi engendrés par celuici. <br><br>Unicité du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou toute entité géographique se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel. De la même façon, la Commission de toponymie du Québec officialise un seul nom pour une voie de communication ou pour chacun des tronçons de celle-ci afin d’éviter qu’une voie sans interruption soit composée de plusieurs tronçons ayant chacun leur propre nom. Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage est déjà établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils satisfont à tous les critères. Dans les cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. Exemple : chemin des Érables Langue de l’élément spécifique Les noms communs qui entrent dans la composition de nouveaux toponymes sont en français. Exemple : chemin des Érables Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots d’une autre langue que le français qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Exemple : chemin Maple Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visés par cette règle et sont écrits dans leur forme originale. Exemple : chemin Queen-Mary Présence et unicité du générique Le nom d’une voie de communication, d’un parc public, d’un édifice ou d’une autre construction comporte toujours un générique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction de générique. Utilisation de génériques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques. Ces génériques sont répertoriés sur le site web de la Commission de toponymie du Québec dans la section Normes et procédures – Terminologie géographique. Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques. Par exemple, le nom officiel Lac du Clocher est repris de façon intégrale dans le nom chemin du Lac-du-Clocher",Application form added to OneDrive folder,mfgagne@ville.boisbriand.qc.ca,45.612222,-73.839167

Cette proposition doit être expliquée et une justification doit être donnée sur la raison pour laquelle aucune proposition de la liste n’a été retenue. 3 Cette liste aura été préalablement soumise au comité pour recommandation au conseil.

Le propriétaire de cette rue, de cette allée d’accès ou de ce lieu est consulté pour trouver un nom à l’entité à nommer. S’il ne soumet aucune proposition au fonctionnaire dans un délai de 30 jours de la signature du protocole d’entente, de l’acceptation du plan image dans le cas d’une allée d’accès ou de l’aménagement du nouveau lieu, le conseil procède au choix du nom, sans plus amples délais. <br><br>Lorsque la rue, l’allée d’accès ou le lieu est déjà existant, le conseil conserve le nom déjà existant ou le modifie après avoir consulté le requérant de cette nouvelle dénomination et son propriétaire. La procédure est enclenchée par la soumission d’une proposition de modification de nom par un requérant. Cette proposition est transmise au propriétaire de cette entité qui a 30 jours pour l’accepter, soumettre une nouvelle proposition ou demander de conserver le nom déjà existant. À l’échéance de ce délai, le conseil décide de conserver le nom existant ou procède au choix d’un nouveau nom, sans plus amples délais. <br><br>Les propositions doivent être faites par écrit et doivent être soumises au fonctionnaire.

La famille pourra prendre 15 jours pour signifier sa position, par écrit. À la réception de la position de la famille ou à l’échéance du délai de 15 jours, s’il y a lieu, le conseil nomme l’entité à nommer. <br><br>Les critères de décision pour nommer une rue, une allée ou un lieu sont : - le respect de la présente politique; - lorsque le nom d’une personne est considéré pour nommer une rue, une allée ou un lieu et qu’il est approprié de le faire, le prénom doit être ajouté; - ne pas se restreindre à l’emplacement physique de la rue, de l’allée ou du lieu pour promouvoir le patrimoine d’un secteur donné; - autant que possible, la proposition soumise ne doit pas être longue. <br><br>Le nom choisi doit être conforme aux critères de choix et aux règles d’écriture établis par la Commission de toponymie du Québec qui approuve et officialise les toponymes et les odonymes. <br><br>Exceptionnellement, une proposition qui ne respecte pas les dispositions de la présente politique pourra être considérée.

Par contre, s’il est possible, il faut également considérer la présente politique (exemple : choisir un peintre ayant un lien avec la ville pour le secteur comportant des noms de peintre); - lorsque le nom est temporaire.

PROCÉDURE POUR PROPOSER UN TOPONYME Toute personne morale ou physique peut soumettre à la Ville de Rouyn-Noranda une proposition de toponyme en soumettant sa proposition à l’aide du formulaire en ligne prévu à cet effet. Le dépôt d’une requête est suivi par l’envoi d’un accusé de réception indiquant au requérant que sa demande sera traitée dans les meilleurs délais lors de la prochaine rencontre du comité patrimoine et toponymie. Toute proposition de dénomination reçue par la Ville est ensuite acheminée au comité. Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne, le comité s’informe auprès de la famille ou des proches pour obtenir plus de détails tout en mentionnant à ces derniers qu’une analyse sera faite. À la suite de l’analyse de la proposition, le comité patrimoine et toponymie peut rejeter une appellation proposée, selon les critères établis. Une lettre expliquant les motifs du refus sera alors acheminée au requérant et le dossier sera fermé. Le conseil municipal sera informé par le biais des comptes rendus des travaux du comité. Dans le cas où une proposition est retenue par le comité patrimoine et toponymie, la Ville verra à obtenir un avis technique de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. Une fois l’avis technique obtenu, le comité transmet sa recommandation au conseil municipal. Dans le cas d’une décision favorable par le conseil municipal, le comité informera la famille de la personne honorée, le cas échéant, et le requérant. Le toponyme sera alors soit versé dans la banque de noms disponibles ou adopté par résolution par le conseil municipal pour désigner un lieu. Une fois la résolution adoptée, celle-ci est transmise à la Commission de toponymie du Québec, qui officialise la nomination. Celle-ci entre en vigueur lors de la réception d’une réponse d’officialisation de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. La Ville achemine alors l’information aux services concernés (urbanisme, évaluation, travaux publics, communications, sécurité civile, Postes Canada, etc.). Dans le cas où un toponyme n’est pas approuvé par le conseil municipal, celui-ci devra retourner le dossier au comité patrimoine et toponymie en mentionnant les raisons pour lesquelles ce nom n’a pas été retenu. Le toponyme pourra alors, selon le cas, être conservé dans la banque de noms, avec une mention du refus. <br><br>5. RÈGLES DE DÉNOMINATION 5.1. Principes directeurs Voici les principes et critères qui sont pris en compte dans l’analyse des propositions déposées : • Souligner le caractère unique du territoire de Rouyn-Noranda et de son histoire. • Afin de favoriser un équilibre, prioriser des noms qui correspondent à une toponymie féminine, autochtone et de la diversité culturelle. Dans le cas de la toponymie autochtone, une attention particulière doit être accordée pour être étudiée de concert avec les communautés concernées. 8 • Tenir compte de la nature du lieu, de son utilisation et de l’histoire du secteur géographique (le bon nom au bon endroit); • Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne, tenir compte de son lien avec le lieu choisi. • Favoriser les noms complets des personnes (prénom et nom); • Lorsqu’il s’agit d’un nom commun, tenir compte des éléments géographiques et topographiques à proximité du lieu ou privilégier les noms pouvant servir à repérer plus facilement l’endroit. • Pour les parcs, favoriser un nom reflétant les caractéristiques du milieu naturel environnant, le nom de la rue adjacente (ou du quartier) pour un meilleur repérage ou le nom d’une personne en lien avec le secteur. • Pour les édifices publics, favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement local, régional ou national. • Lorsqu’un nouveau développement résidentiel se présente, privilégier un thème commun pour la désignation des nouvelles rues, sans toutefois l’exiger. • Éviter l'emploi de noms à connotation péjorative ou grossière, de même que les choix susceptibles de provoquer ou d'alimenter une dissension ou controverse. • Ne pas retenir comme toponyme le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. • Éviter les noms à consonance semblable (homonyme) ou doublons qui pourraient confondre le repérage par les services d’urgence. • Respecter les règles d’écritures établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec. • Ne pas faire disparaître un toponyme en le remplaçant par un autre. Par contre, advenant qu’un toponyme soit jugé largement controversé, un changement pourrait alors être envisagé. <br> <br><br>5.2. Types de désignations Il existe différents types de désignations : • Honorifique : Pour évoquer la mémoire de personnes qui se sont distinguées au sein de la communauté de Rouyn-Noranda dans les domaines artistique, communautaire, économique, éducatif, religieux, scientifique, social, sportif, etc. • Historique : Pour évoquer la mémoire de personnages de l’histoire locale comme des pionniers et pionnières, des vieilles et grandes familles d’un quartier, un évènement marquant, etc. 9 • Géographique : Pour évoquer des traits géographiques ou faisant appel aux traits caractéristiques d’un lieu. • Thématique : Celle-ci est utilisée lorsque plusieurs emplacements à nommer sont regroupés dans un même développement urbain ou rural. Dans ce cas, il est possible d’évoquer des noms de personnalité et des noms communs en lien avec la thématique retenue.",Form A Honorary or Historical Designation: https://formulaires.rouyn-noranda.ca/proposition-de-toponymie-formulaire-a-honorifique-ou-historique/ <br><br>Form B Significant Event Designation: https://formulaires.rouyn-noranda.ca/proposition-de-toponymie-formulaire-b-evenement-marquant/ <br><br>Form C Geographical or Thematic Designation: https://formulaires.rouyn-noranda.ca/proposition-de-toponymie-formulaire-c-geographique-ou-thematique/,info@rouyn-noranda.ca,48.239167,-79.016389

quebec_saint-bruno-de-montarville,,record,Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville,Quebec,Yes,"1.1 Contexte Au Québec, la Commission de toponymie a le mandat d’effectuer l’inventaire, la normalisation, l’officialisation et la diffusion des noms de lieux. Les municipalités sont cependant responsables du choix de leurs noms de voies de communication, ou odonymes, ainsi que de celui des noms de parcs publics, d’édifices et d’autres constructions qui leur appartiennent. La Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville accueillera au cours des prochaines années, des projets nécessitant l’aménagement de nouvelles rues. La présente politique de dénomination toponymique est un outil pour orienter les choix de toponymes pour le conseil local de patrimoine et de toponymie et le conseil municipal. Elle édicte des lignes directrices en matière de toponymie garantissant, par le fait même, une qualité odonymique sur son territoire. La politique permet à la Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville de gérer efficacement l’ensemble des dossiers toponymiques et d’améliorer la méthodologie en matière de dénomination. 1.2 Objectifs La politique de dénomination toponymique vise à : - Mettre en valeur les particularités et les spécificités locales propres à chaque secteur du territoire de la Ville; - Mettre en valeur l’histoire et le patrimoine de la Ville par la dénomination de ses rues, ses chemins, ses lieux et ses bâtiments; - Développer un sentiment d’appartenance des citoyens par la dénomination; - Établir une démarche claire et respectueuse pour procéder à la dénomination toponymique des lieux. 1.3 Champs d’application La présente politique s’applique à toutes requêtes de dénomination toponymique, peu importe la nature et la provenance. Elle inclut celles initiées par les diverses instances de la Ville. Le conseil local du patrimoine et de toponymie doit exercer sa mission sur le territoire de la Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. Les lieux et les espaces à désigner sont : - Les voies de communication (rues, chemins, etc.); - Les parcs et espaces verts publics; - Les édifices et salles publiques à l’intérieur des édifices; - Les équipements sportifs ou culturels publics; - Tous les autres lieux ou espaces d’intérêt public. <br><br>4. PROCÉDURES 4.1 Dépôt d’une demande de dénomination toponymique Tout citoyen, groupe de personnes ou organisme qui dépose une demande de dénomination toponymique doit remplir le formulaire prévu à cet effet et le déposer à la Direction de l’urbanisme, de l’environnement et du développement durable. Le requérant a la responsabilité de fournir toutes les informations relatives au toponyme proposé nécessaires à l’analyse de sa demande, expliquer l’essence du toponyme proposé et les raisons pour lesquelles il devrait être officialisé. <br><br>5. RÈGLES DE DÉNOMINATION 5.1 Critères d’analyse dictés par la Ville - Relation entre le nom et le lieu qu’il désigne - Favoriser les noms ayant un lien logique, étroit et d’intérêt avec le lieu; - Tenir compte de la nature et de l’usage du lieu (voie, parc, place publique, immeuble, contexte résidentiel, commercial, industriel ou culturel, etc.); - Tenir compte des caractéristiques géographiques naturelles du lieu (faune, flore, géologie, etc.); - Tenir compte de l’histoire du quartier en termes urbain (usages actuels ou passés) et social (pionniers, longévité familiale sur les lieux, anecdotes); - Tenir compte des traditions du milieu local ou régional (surnom du lieu). - Originalité, valeur poétique et euphonie (harmonie des sons) - Favoriser les noms inspirant des images fortes; - Préserver les régionalismes; - Éviter les toponymes banals et utilisés fréquemment; - Éviter les toponymes servant de désignation publicitaire; - Éviter les noms dont l’attribution pourrait provoquer la controverse. - Sentiment d’appartenance - Favoriser les noms mettant en valeur l’identité montarvilloise, les lieux d’appartenance et le caractère du milieu dans lequel il s’inscrit. - Mise en valeur du patrimoine culturel - Favoriser les noms issus de l’histoire et du patrimoine local, régional ou national (référence à une personne, un fait ou un événement); - Honorer une seule fois une même personne ou chose. - Point de repère - Tenir compte de la toponymie existante; - Favoriser les noms permettant de se repérer plus facilement; - Éviter les homonymes et les doublons. - Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne : - Favoriser le nom de personnes ayant contribué de façon significative au développement, au dynamisme ou au bien-être de la communauté; - Privilégier le nom sous lequel la personne est la mieux connue (nom complet, titre accompagné du nom complet, pseudonyme, etc.); - Retenir le nom complet de la personne (prénom et nom de famille); - Recourir au nom de famille seul pour honorer une famille complète. <br><br>5.2 Critères de choix prescrits par la Commission Le nom doit respecter les règles d’écriture et être conforme aux critères de choix de la Commission. - Unicité du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou entité géographique se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel. - Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils ne dérogent pas à d’autres critères. Dans les cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. - Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. Exemple : Chemin De La Rabastalière Ouest - Langue de l’élément spécifique Les noms communs composant de nouveaux toponymes sont en français. Exemple : Chemin De La Rabastalière Ouest Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots d’une autre langue que le français qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Exemple : Chemin Maple Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visés par cette règle et sont écrits dans leur forme originale. Exemple : Place Stephen-Leacock - Présence et unicité du générique Le nom d’une voie de communication, d’un parc public, d’un édifice ou d’une autre construction comporte toujours un générique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction de générique. - Utilisation de génériques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de l’Office québécois de la langue française). - Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. - Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel est utilisé pour composer un autre toponyme, il doit en respecter la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques. Exemple : Le nom officiel « Lac Seigneurial » est repris de façon intégrale dans le nom « Chemin du Lac-Seigneurial ». 5.3 Particularités Lorsqu’une rue est prolongée, c’est-à-dire qu’elle n’est pas sectionnée par une intersection, il est préférable de garder le même odonyme. Si le prolongement rejoint une autre rue existante avec un nom différent, l’odonyme choisi doit être le même que l’une des rues qu’il rejoint.",N/A,information@stbruno.ca,45.526007,-73.340591

PROCESSES 4.1 The naming of municipal parks, streets, and facilities and other municipal assets may involve a different process which will depend on the circumstances surrounding the request/requirement for naming. A. Naming a Municipal Street • The process for naming of new municipal streets shall occur as part of the final subdivision/development approval process and prior to the Town of Cobourg acquiring title to the lands as a road allowance. The process for re-naming an existing municipal street shall begin once the Town of Cobourg has received a written request which includes the background and rationale for considering the street name change, as per the criteria established by this policy. The Cobourg Planning Department receives a written request by the proponent or developer for a name(s) which includes the proposed municipal street name(s) and an explanation of the significance of the name. In the absence of a submission for consideration of a name by the developer or proponent, Planning Department staff will provide the Coordinator of Planning and Development Services with the names available for use as recommended by municipal staff for the specific municipal street(s). The proposed street name(s) will then be included in the Planning Departments report to Council as part of the subdivision/development final approval process or municipal street re-naming process as the case may be. • Conditions of property donation and/or property improvements or development as agreed upon by the donor/developer and the Town shall be honoured regarding the naming of the municipal street(s) subject to this policy and final approval by Council resolution. • Processing of an application for a municipal street name request involves confirmation criteria including; submission of relevant background justification by the developer or proponent, discussion with the developer or proponent, discussion with and review by Cobourg municipal staff, including emergency services, and the Cobourg Heritage Advisory Committee where deemed necessary (within the Heritage Districts), and consultation with the Council Coordinator of Planning and Development Services. The Planning Department shall inform the developer or the proponent if the name is known to conflict with existing street names or is otherwise unacceptable to any of the parties consulted and shall provide a reason why the name is not acceptable. Commemorative municipal street name(s) shall be the responsibility of the Planning Department and the Town of Cobourg. Where a request for a commemorative street name has been made, the name shall be evaluated through the criteria and evaluation process of this policy and the processing may include consultation with additional stakeholders as deemed necessary. B. Naming of a Municipal Park or Facility • The process for naming of municipal parks or facilities should begin when the Town of Cobourg acquires titles to lands or within twelve (12) months after the Town has acquired titles to lands and once the lands have developed into a park or facility. • Proposed park and facility names are either: 1.
