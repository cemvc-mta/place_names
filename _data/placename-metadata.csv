This policy defines the steps that shall be followed when it is proposed that: ï‚· the name of an existing road or street (public or private) be changed or the name or boundaries of a community be changed; or ï‚· the Municipality assign the name of a new road, street or road reserve as a result of subdivision of land pursuant to the Subdivision Bylaw; or ï‚· the Municipality assign the name of a new private road or street or road reserve as a result of subdivision of land pursuant to the Subdivision Bylaw; or ï‚· a name be assigned to an existing road or community not previously named. New names for roads, streets and communities will be carefully reviewed to minimize the potential for conflicts with existing names. Changing the name of a road, street or community has important historical and public safety implications with preference or greater consideration to be given to the traditional name acknowledged by local residents. Accordingly, a name change should only be considered in a very limited number of situations. Emergency responder services shall be consulted as a part of any civic address change process. 

BASIC POLICY PRINCIPLES 4.1 Procedures and evaluation criteria. Unless otherwise stated, the procedures and evaluation criteria are to be in accordance with the guidelines specified in the Nova Scotia Civic Address File (NSCAF) Pilot Project - Final Report. 4.2 Duplication, numbers, suffixes or prefixes are to be avoided. There should be no duplication or near duplication of road and community names within the Municipality. Numerals should not appear in a road or community name nor names differentiated by just a prefix or suffix. Examples - If Bayview Boulevard exists in the County, this name (with or without add-ons) would not be accepted for another community in the County. - Since the community of Port Lorne exists, this name (with or without changes in prefixes or suffixes) would not be accepted for another community in the County (such as Fort Lorne, Upper Port Lorne, Port Lorne Extension). - 1 st Avenue or 2nd Street would not be acceptable. - First Avenue or Second Street would be acceptable. - Upper Station Road or Lower Water Street would not be acceptable. - If Portland Road exists, the name Portland Street would not be acceptable. 

4.3 Confusion is to be avoided. In order to minimize diction problems when reporting road names under stress, names that sound very similar are to be avoided. Examples - If Smith Road exists; then Smyth Road, Smithâ€™s Road or Smit Road would not be accepted. - Since the community of Lawrencetown exists, then Lorncetown, Laurencetown, Lewiston or Lawrenceville would not be accepted. 4.4 Continuity of road name to be a criteria. A road running in one compass direction should have one name only and should, at least within a community, have the same name throughout its entire length. 4.5 Changing an existing name is to be discouraged. A request to change the name of a road, street or community will be considered only if: 4.5.1 there are valid public safety considerations which affect the civic address system and/or the E911 database; or 4.5.2 valid issues have been sufficiently documented and adequately presented relative to community identity, heritage and traditions; and 4.5.3 property owners have been adequately informed and a 2/3 majority or greater of area residents support the change of road name as evidenced by a community survey in an approved format; or 4.5.4 there are important civic objectives or purposes which may be achieved by approving a change; and 4.5.5 the change is approved by Municipal Council. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA 

5.1 General Criteria 5.1.1 Names that existed prior to approval of this policy are hereby accepted unless the Civic Addressing Coordinator determines a change in name is necessary. 5.1.2 Only English or French versions will be accepted, with appropriate accents being applied in accordance to the rules of the language and the English version being easy to pronounce, recognizable and easy to spell. 5.1.3 The long-standing, local usage of the name by the local public will be given preference. 5.1.4 Names must reflect good taste as perceived by the general public. 5.1.5 Names submitted with special characters will only be accepted if found in the ASCH special character set (See Schedule A) 5.1.6 Qualifying words (upper, lower, new, old, north, south, east, west, etc.) will not be accepted for proposed changes or new names unless such qualifier is found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer or if approved by the Civic Addressing Coordinator. 5.1.7 All names for roads or streets must have an associated road type, and only road types identified in Section 5.3 will be accepted. 5.1.8 Road names containing a number must be alphanumeric (such as First Street) and submissions using a numeric (such as 1st Street) will not be accepted. 5.1.9 Name submissions for communities and roads (including road type) shall have a total of no more than 35 characters. 5.1.10 The following identifiers or references are not acceptable: (1) homonyms or like sounding names within the Municipality; for example, â€œSmithâ€, Smythâ€, Smytheâ€, â€œSmithâ€™sâ€, â€œSmithsâ€, â€œSmitâ€ or â€œSmitsâ€.

(3) formal titles of distinctions associated with a person name such as Captain, Major or Doctor. (4) company or commercial product names and names associated with copyright or trademarks. 5.1.11 Ownership of land should not in itself be grounds for the application of the ownerâ€™s name to a road or community, nor does ownership confer the right to specify the name without consultation with area residents. 5.1.12 Mixed language name submissions should be avoided (example: Chapeau Road or Port Petite community).

Avoid duplication - there should be no duplication of road names and numbers used as names should be avoided. It is also preferable not to differentiate road and street names exclusively by selecting a different road type, for example, Portland Road and Portland Drive. 1.2. Avoid confusion - road names that sound very similar should be avoided. The reason for avoiding similar or similar sounding names is to eliminate diction problems when people are reporting road names under stress. 1.3. Establish continuity - a road running in one compass direction should have one name only and should have the same name throughout its entire length in the Municipality and, if possible, in adjoining municipalities. 2. In particular, the following standards shall be applied: 2.1.

Qualifying words such as Upper, Lower, New, Old, etc., should be avoided unless the qualifying word has been applied in some other official context (for example as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer); 4. All names must have an associated road type and the road type should conform with the road type criteria in the attached Road Type Schedule â€œBâ€, but existing non- conforming road types may be continued to avoid the cost, confusion and disturbance of changing only a road type; 5. Road names must only contain letters and road names containing numbers will be rejected: for example, ""First Street"" would be acceptable, but ""1st"" Street"" would not be accepted. 6. Where a new road is a continuation of an existing road, wherever possible the new road will be given the same name as the existing road. 7. There will be no duplication of road names within the Municipality and, if possible, duplication of names with names used in immediately adjoining municipal units should be avoided. 8. Road names, including abbreviated road type, shall have no more than 35 characters. 9. If the road is named after a topographic feature or place name, the name should reflect the official name as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer. 10. Naming streets for individuals is a common practice, but typically it is only acceptable if the person is deceased, or noteworthy of such a request. Formal titles of distinction, such as Captain, Major, Admiral, etc., should be avoided. 11.

NovaScotia_Berwick,,,Berwick,Nova Scotia,Yes,"Street Name Policy:
The Town of Berwick recognizes that there are several factors that should be considered when the need for new street names within the town arises. A referral from the Planning Advisory Committee will be forwarded to the Apple Capital Museum Society requesting the development of a standing list of suitable street names which Council can draw upon when considering the naming of new, or renaming of existing streets, in the Town. Prior to Council making the final name selection as required, the potential street name shall be forwarded to the local police, fire, ambulance and public works agencies to determine any potential logistical or technical problems associated with the name that would impede the completion of their respective duties. In making its recommendation the Society will consider, as a minimum, the criteria listed below. Assessment Criteria  

- any historical significance associated with the area;  

- names of local areas or landmarks of significance;  

-names of families or individuals of importance to the Town of Berwick  

-names of former Mayors of the Town of Berwick  

-names of former Fire Chiefs of the Town of Berwick former street names;  

-any existing pattern in respect to the naming of other streets in the Town; and  

-any previous street name requests  

The Society will provide supporting history and information to Council regarding the standing list of potential street names. In the case of the development of new roadways within the Town, the selection of street names will be finalized after conveyance of the infrastructure from the developer/owner to the Town of Berwick.

NewfoundlandandLabrador_StJohns,,,St. John's,Newfoundland and Labrador,Yes,"Street Naming: 

This new policy provides formalized guidance for existing practices, while allowing the incorporation of best practices from other jurisdictions. The new Street Naming Advisory Committee (replacing the Nomenclature Committee) will review street naming applications received from both developers and the general public. The Committee will also solicit feedback from the Inclusion Advisory Committee, and other groups as required, in order to support a more equitable and diverse selection of names. The policy also addresses the issue of street renaming requests. Such requests will only be considered if there is an engineering rationale or the continued use of the name would not be in the best interest of the City. Requestors must be City residents or property owners and will need to provide a petition with support from a majority of property owners on the Street before the request will be processed for further consideration. 

Key Considerations/Implications: 1. Budget/Financial Implications: There are no expected immediate financial implications and the policy will not result in any immediate cost increases. The policy does note that City will not reimburse any costs that may be incurred by any property owner due to reassignment. The naming and renaming of streets have associated costs for the City (signage, staff time, contractor time), which are not currently allocated in any budget. When seeking approval of a specific new street name or a street to be renamed, Council will be provided with an estimated cost for implementation. 2. Partners or Other Stakeholders: ï‚· Inclusion Advisory Committee (IAC) ï‚· St. Johnâ€™s Regional Fire Department ï‚· Other emergency services (police, ambulance) ï‚· St. Johnâ€™s Transportation Commission ï‚· Electrical utilities and telecommunications providers 3. Alignment with Strategic Directions/Adopted Plans: â€œAn Effective Cityâ€ Goal: â€œWork with our employees to improve organizational performance through effective processes and policiesâ€. 4. Alignment with Adopted Plans: This policy will interact with the Development Regulations, as developers will be required to follow the new process for street naming. 5. Accessibility and Inclusion: The IAC will be consulted prior to adding names to the Reserved Street Names Inventory. 6. Legal or Policy Implications: The Office of the City Solicitor has reviewed and approved the policy. 7. Privacy Implications: Implementation of the policy will require compliance with the Cityâ€™s Privacy Management Policy and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015. The Cityâ€™s Access and Privacy Analyst was consulted during the development of the policy, procedures and related forms. 8. Engagement and Communications Considerations: Discussions with the Marketing and Communications Division have begun regarding communications of the new policy. Once the policy is operational, there will be ongoing engagement requirements for any street renaming and the Committee will discuss how to proceed with the Organizational Performance and Strategy Division. 9. Human Resource Implications: The policy will be implemented with existing human resources. However, should the City receive an influx of multiple requests for street renaming over a short period of time, additional resources may be required. 10.Procurement Implications: For streets that are named or renamed, there will be a need for contracted services to install signage, using approved procurement policies and procedures. 11.Information Technology Implications: Not applicable. 12.Other Implications: Not applicable.

Naming and Sponsorship: 

Municipal Naming of Town of Banff properties and assets (such as parks, buildings, structures and neighbourhoods) is the process for Town Council to assign a long-term or permanent name, in order to provide unambiguous identification of locations to enhance navigation within the Banff town site. Municipal Naming also serves as a means to celebrate our culture, role in the national park, and the unique identity of this mountain community, its heritage, geography, flora, fauna or natural features associated with the town. Town Council can commemorate important events or honour the outstanding achievements or significant community contributions of groups, organizations or individuals. Municipal Naming is applied in situations where the Town does not receive from external parties a financial contribution, goods or services, or when a contribution has been donated, but the external party does not seek reciprocal consideration. This policy complements the objectives of the Addressing Bylaw, which applies to naming of streets and roadways.

Statement from senior town planner: 

  

""We do not have a 'name bank' as such. Historically, western settlements have adopted the simple numeric naming formula (i.e. 1st Street/Ave, 2nd Street/Ave, etc). This naming convention aligns very well with the grid system street network that is the prevailing urban development pattern for prairie communities.  

  

Typically the numbering will be centred on a main thoroughfare which was often the railroad. You can see this in many southern Alberta communities which have a 'Railway Avenue', 'Main Street' or 'Centre Street' that is usually located adjacent to the historic rail line. 

  

With regards to new development, our naming conventions are oftentimes tied to the specific subdivision. For example: the streets within the 'Parkside Acres' subdivision in Coaldale are 'Parkside Green', 'Parkside Drive', and 'Parkside Way'. Streets within the 'Cottonwood Estates' are named after different types of trees (i.e. Aspen Drive, Cedar Crescent, Elm Place, etc.). These names may be proposed by the developer, but must be ultimately approved by the Town Council. 

  

In terms of place naming, there are a few possible methods: 

- the place is named for a benefactor, donor or sponsor (i.e. Kinship Park for the Kinsmen Club of Coaldale) 

- the place is named by the developer when they plan a subdivision for the area (i.e. Cottonwood Park is within the Cottonwood Estates subdivision)'"" ",N/A,hailey.winder@coaldale.ca,49.727778,-112.618611

Quote from the city:  

â€œWe informally use Airdrieâ€™s street naming policy for neighbourhoods (which encourages the use of a neighbourhood theme and a variety of suffixes to denote the style of roadway such a cul-de-sac vs a main entrance, vs a crescent,etc) while having a numbered grid system in the traditional downtown.  We do not have a name bank, but when asked we do partner with the Stockmanâ€™s Library (which is a local archival library), CHAPS (the Cochrane Historical Archival & Preservation Society) and our organization is slowly making more connections with the indigenous nations that abut our municipality to provide some options.  Situated in the foothills in between Calgary and the Rocky Mountains, we are surrounded by and sit within significant natural landscape features that also offer plenty of name options. For the most part, new neighbourhood names are first offered by the landowner/developer and we go from there.â€ ",N/A,planning@cochrane.ca,51.206667,-114.466944

Proposed themes must not be used if there are roadway names already in use elsewhere within the City that may be perceived as being associated with the theme areas. 

Names used for roadways must be clearly associated with the theme. Names should be easily recognized as being related to a given theme by individuals not well versed or regarded as 

'expert' with respect to the theme.Names used for roadways must be clearly associated with the theme. Names should be easily recognized as being related to a given theme by individuals not well versed or regarded as 

'expert with respect to the theme. 

Where words used within a theme are not easily recognized as being associated with the theme, prefixes or other qualifiers may be used, e.g. Mt. For the names of mountains, or St. for the names of saints.Names proposed need not be English; however, a name will be rejected if a potential conflict is created when translated into English, e.g. Uno Avenue (Spanish) vs. 1 Avenue.Differences in spelling, e.g. Wolf vs. Wolfe are not sufficiently distinctive and would require some qualification, e.g. Thomas Wolfe vs. Virginia Wolf. Qualification of the same does not imply acceptance.

sacrifice of local veterans in the service of Canada; Therefore be it resolved that
Council hereby directs the appropriate staff (after ensuring that there are no
impediments) and a Council representative to engage with the Erin Royal
Canadian Legion to present appropriate recommendations for the naming of the
following Town of Erin Parks (currently all unnamed, unsigned or unknown):
â€¢ Ballinafad â€“ the Park on Sandalwood Drive
â€¢ Crewsons Corners â€“ the Park on Crewsons Court
â€¢ Orton â€“ the Park on Elizabeth Crescent
â€¢ Ospringe â€“ the new Park in the Thomasfield Subdivision and the small parkette
located midway on Stewart Driveâ€
Staff have reached out to the Erin Royal Canadian Legion to obtain Street Names and
Park names in the past. Several veteran names can be seen in a number of
56
developments that were recently constructed in the Town of Erin. Staff and are
proposing to continue with this process in the future.
In order to assist with assigning street and park names when they are requested staff
are proposing to form a â€œStreet and Park Naming Committeeâ€. This Committee will
consist of the following members:
- The Mayor
- The Council representative to the Heritage Committee
- The Clerk
- The Director of Infrastructure Services
The process for naming street would be as follows;

The City of Ottawa is committed to providing a fair, consistent and efficient process, while respecting the important need for public consultation and legislative approvals, with respect to commemorative naming of municipal streets, parks, and parts of parks, facilities, and parts of facilities after a person, persons, or family name. 

Definitions 

For the purpose of this policy, the following definitions apply. 

Commemorative - shall refer to the official naming of a municipal street, park, part of a park, facility, or part of a facility, to commemorate a person, persons, or family. 

Purpose 

The main objectives of this policy are: 

To ensure a clear, efficient and timely naming process; 

To ensure the application of key criteria to determine the validity of a commemorative name; 

To ensure the application of a concrete consultation process and community participation; 

To ensure one central repository for all commemorative naming requests for streets, parks, parts of parks, facilities, or parts of facilities. 

To ensure the proper approval process and the importance of the role played by legislative bodies (i.e. Committee and Council approval and Ottawa Public Library (OPL) Board approval when necessary); and 

To serve as a working group that develops recommendations on commemorative names for Councilâ€™s consideration. 

Application 

This policy applies to all City employees, including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees, summer students and co-op placements, and persons acting on behalf of the City (e.g. consultants, contractors), as well as Members of Council and the public with respect to the commemorative naming of municipal streets, parks, parts of parks, facilities and parts of facilities after a person, persons, or family name. 

Any member of the public or City Council may submit a nomination for the commemorative naming of a municipal park, facility or street. For commemoration purposes, the term municipal park shall include other components, such as sporting fields contained within a larger park. The term municipal facility shall include other components, such as ice rinks or meeting rooms contained within a City facility, subject to any existing sponsorship naming rights with the subject facility.  

Policy Requirements 

The policy is, above all, principles-based with an emphasis on public consultation, a dignified process for nominees, and respect for Councilâ€™s decision making authority.  

Criteria 

Where the naming of a street, municipal park, parts of a park, facility, or parts of a facility is being requested, at least one of the following criteria shall apply: 

The nominated individual shall have demonstrated excellence, courage or exceptional service to the citizens of the City of Ottawa, the Province of Ontario and/or Canada; 

The nominated individual shall have an extraordinary community service record; 

The nominated individual shall have worked to foster equality and reduce discrimination;

No Memorials 

The Policy is not open to commemorate an individualâ€™s death.  These applications will be directed to the Commemorative Bench Program, the Commemorative Tree Program, Roadside Memorial Sign Program, or other appropriate memorial program. 

Commemorative Naming Application Form 

The commemorative naming information sheet, application form, and required affidavits are available in French and English through the contact noted at the end of this policy document. 

Processes 

The commemorative naming process for municipal streets, parks, parts of parks, facilities, and parts of facilities may involve a different course of action depending on the circumstances surrounding the request/requirement for naming. 

A. Process for Parks and Facilities 

Receipt of a Nomination/Application: All requests for commemorative naming are to be submitted in writing by completing the Commemorative Naming Application Form and supporting documentation. 

Processing of the Nomination/Application: Processing the application involves confirmation of criteria, reference checks (if applicable), discussion with the applicant and applicable City departments, initial meeting of the Commemorative Naming Committee (â€œCNCâ€), public consultation for a 30-day period, compiling consultation results, and a reconvening meeting of the CNC for a review of the public consultation results, if required. 

Report to Council: When a name is recommended for approval, a report to the appropriate Standing Committee and Council is prepared containing the CNCâ€™s recommendation with the exception of the naming of OPL buildings and spaces within (including mobile units), which will be approved by the OPL Board. 

Implementation of Approved Nomination: Upon Committee and Council approval, implementation of the approved commemorative name is undertaken. This involves final notification to the nominator and nominee and an official unveiling ceremony for the nominee and family with the presentation of a plaque to be erected at the site, indicating the name as well as its significance for commemoration (the OPL assumes responsibility for any associated library naming event). 

In cases where there is no opposition received during the public consultation period, a report can be submitted directly to the appropriate Standing Committee and Council, without the reconvening of the CNC for a second meeting. Opposition is defined as a clear expression that the candidate in question does not meet the criteria for commemoration as outlined in this policy, and does not include general comments in opposition to the principles of the policy. 

B. Process for Commemorative Street Naming 

Commemorative street names shall remain the responsibility of the Building Code Services Branch. Where a request for a commemorative street name has been made, initial contact with Building Code Services Branch is made. The name will be vetted through the investigation and criteria evaluation process of this policy. Once endorsed, it will be forwarded to the Building Code Services Branch for processing in accordance with the Municipal Addressing By-law. A meeting of the CNC is not required for the naming of a street. 

Public Consultation 

Notice and public consultation shall be undertaken in accordance with the size and scope of the park or facility being named, and in consultation with affected Members of Council. The public consultation period shall last 30 calendar days. 

Written submissions and/or petitions received during the public consultation phase must be verifiable. To that end: 

Each written submission must include the submitterâ€™s full first and last name; and 

Any petition must adhere to the guidelines outlined in Councilâ€™s Petition Policy with respect to petition requirements. 

Upon request, City staff will provide the final decision on a proposal to individuals who submit a comment under the public consultation component, and provide a copy of the Commemorative Naming policy and redacted application form. 

Commemorative Naming Committee (â€œCNCâ€) 

The CNC, a staff-Council committee, is composed of the following representatives: 

City Clerk (or designate) 

General Manager, Recreation, Cultural and Facility Services Department (or designate) 

General Manager, Public Works and Environmental Services Department (or designate) 

General Manager, Planning, Infrastructure and Economic Development Department (or designate) 

Mayor (or designate) 

Ward Councillor (or designate) 

Ottawa Public Library CEO (or designate) if required 

Ottawa Public Library Board Chair (or designate) if required 

In the event that a park or facility crosses ward boundaries and is located in more than one ward, all affected ward Councillors shall be considered part of the CNC. Furthermore, in instances where the proposal is of a â€œCity-wideâ€ nature or significance, the General Manager, Recreation, Cultural and Facility Services may recommend that a chair (or designate) of a standing committee or board be invited to participate on the CNC. 

The Council and Committee Services Unit within the Office of the City Clerk shall oversee the coordination of the CNC and associated reports to the appropriate Standing Committee and Council. 

Multiple Names 

In instances where multiple names have been submitted for a single street, park or facility, the CNC may select one or more proposal(s) to move forward. 

The CNC supports public consultation in a manner that is dignified for nominees.  As such, the CNC may expand or narrow the number of proposals for a particular street, park or facility, as it deems appropriate.  

Renaming 

The renaming process shall be identical to the commemorative naming process and also require City Council as the final authority for approving the proposed park or facility name. However, the renaming of an existing commemoration shall be subject to a 60-day public consultation period. 

Other 

A Member of Council may request that the CNC address other commemorations such as the naming of other public features or public spaces.  Although not applicable under this policy, a Member of Council may also request that the CNC conduct public consultation on a name that is not that of a person, persons, or family.   

Exceptions 

In keeping with its powers set out in the Municipal Act, 2001, Council may assign a commemorative name by resolution, notwithstanding the provisions included in the Commemorative Naming Policy. 

The Ottawa Police Services Board has delegated authority for the naming of municipal police buildings in whole or in part.

a) An Opening or Re-opening of a Building or Bridge 

For the opening or re-opening of a building which may be the result of a capital building campaign, Council approves the proposed business plan which includes a plan for contribution recognition upon receipt of public donations. Citizens of London contribute to this campaign for numerous reasons including being recognized through receiving appreciation from the City and/or having their name located on a plaque board or on a particular feature of the building or park. Donations made for a building campaign are usually collected by a community group toward the project. 

The names of the Mayor, the appropriate Standing Committee of Council and Ward Councillors may be noted on a recognition plaque when the names are those of the Council which approved the project. 

b) A Civic Recognition 

A civic recognition may be requested by a member of the public or may be initiated by the City itself to recognize a group or an individualâ€™s outstanding accomplishments, involvement or work in the local community or in a provincial or national forum. 

c) International, National or Provincial Events/Competitions 

A naming or re-naming of a building or an amenity within it in recognition of it being a venue for international, national or provincial events/competitions will occur to fulfill a condition agreed to by the City as part of its hosting obligations. Council may also consider the naming or re-naming of such a facility or amenity to recognize an individual, group or corporation who donates significantly toward meeting the cost of hosting the event/competition. The naming or re-naming may be for the duration of a specified number of years, at any time after which Council in its sole discretion may re-name the building or amenity. 

d)  New Park Development 

Planning and Economic Development is responsible for naming new parks which are developed as part of the subdivision development process. The names selected for new parks continue the current naming/re-naming practice adopting the area, subdivision or planning district name in which the park is located to provide a geographical association to help the public to locate the park more easily. 

e) Corporate Sponsorship 

The Cityâ€™s Corporate Sponsorship and Advertising Policy outlines the situations and specific application criteria. It applies to all business relationships between The Corporation of the City of London and businesses which contribute either financially or in-kind to City programs, services or facilities in return for recognition, public acknowledgement or other promotional considerations.

c) The re-naming of an entire building or property could include:

ii) subdividing or portioning off a particular property or feature to be given a new name or sub name; or, 

iii) placing the names of an organization (or individuals) on a plaque to recognize their contributions if it is found that it is inappropriate to name a particular property or building in its entirety. 

4.9  Corporate Sponsorship Naming/Renaming 

In addition to the general civic renaming considerations noted in part 4.8, above, corporate sponsorship naming/renaming initiatives shall: 

a) have a specific sunset clause associated with the length of time that the corporate name will be used, with no guarantee of perpetuity;

NAMING CRITERIA AND GUIDELINES All proposed names for any municipal facilities, property, features and amenities shall conform to the majority of the following guidelines; â€¢	 Names should give a sense of place, continuity, belonging and celebrate distinguishing characteristics and uniqueness of Welland. â€¢	 Names should maintain a long-standing local area identification with residents of Welland. â€¢	 Names should be consistent with any other applicable City of Welland policies and standards â€¢	 Names which reflect and/or imply a reference to any of the following WILL NOT be eligible; names of living individuals unless by exception approved by Council or as a result of a significant financial contribution made by a donor; political affiliation; derogatory or offensive terms or references; discrimination against race, gender, ethnicity, or creed; duplication; tobacco or alcoholic products; names considered inappropriate for a civic amenity or inconsistent with the Corporate Strategic Directions and/or Vision for the City. In addition to the previously mentioned restrictions and guidelines, the City of Welland has three accepted categories for the selection of names for municipal facilities, properties, features and amenities. The three accepted categories do not apply to naming requests acknowledging significant financial gifts. The three accepted categories are geographic, historic and prominent individuals and/or organizations. GEOGRAPHIC - Names having a geographical affiliation, which may include but are not limited to the following references; â€¢	 a neighborhood, community, or subdivision . â€¢	 an adjacent street â€¢	 a noteworthy physical, environmental or scenic quality â€¢	 an unique site characteristic or scenic quality â€¢	 proximity to a recognized facility or area â€¢	 topographical or ecological characteristics HISTORIC - Names having a historical affiliation, which may include but are not limited to the following references; â€¢	 a local or national historical event â€¢	 a heritage event PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS AND/OR ORGANIZATIONS - Names affiliated with individuals and/or organizations, the following criteria will be used to weigh the suitability of the name being proposed; â€¢	 individuals or families having a historical connection to the site (such as a previous landowner) â€¢	 individuals and/or organizations having a significant contribution to the community/City in one or more of the following areas; 1) Service as an elected representative to the municipal, provincial or federal government for at least two terms 2) Service as a member of a public board, committee or commission 3) Service in a voluntary capacity in community organizations such as service clubs, cultural groups, unions, ethnic organizations, community associations, professional organizations, etc. 4) Service in a voluntary or philanthropic capacity or having made a significant contribution in the areas of agriculture, arts and culture, co-operatives, education, business or industry, journalism, medicine, politics, religion, science, public service, recreation or sports on a local, provincial, national or international scale. In those cases where names are affiliated with individuals and/or organizations, the following criteria must be met; â€¢	 The contributions of the individual and/or organization must be well documented and broadly acknowledged within the community â€¢	 To the extent where possible, a direct relationship should exist between the individual and/or organization and the amenity being considered for naming/renaming. â€¢	 The reputation of the individual and/or organization must be honorable, as the term implies, to be considered for naming/renaming. â€¢	 Where an amenity is to be named/renamed after someone who is deceased, permission and agreement must be obtained from the next of kin or legal representative involved prior to consideration and review by the City. Where the names of deceased individuals are being considered, a five year waiting period after the death of the individual must be observed before considering the name for commemoration in naming such amenity. The rationale for this is to ensure that amenities are not precipitously named/renamed in the initial emotional outpourings after the death of a public figure or prominent individual. The names of living persons shall not be permitted unless used in the recognition of a significant financial contribution or by exception approved by Council. DONOR RECOGNITION - SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL GIFTS The City of Welland will consider naming a public amenity as a means of providing recognition for significant financial gifts to the City, in accordance with this and other applicable city policies. The guidelines under the NAMING CRITERIA - GENERAL GUIDELINES section will apply. The term ""SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL GIFT"" implies a minimum monetary donation of 35% of the total real or capital cost or appraised value, whichever is greater, of the amenity being considered for naming/renaming. The names of living individuals may be used in recognition of significant financial gifts. The City of Welland reserves the right to immediately withdraw a name from an amenity should that name come into disrepute in the City or in the general community. RENAMING OF EXISTING MUNICIPAL AMENITIES Recognizing that established names contribute significantly to community identity and pride, proposals to rename existing municipal amenities must be predicated by exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, existing names will not be changed without the considering the historical significance of the existing name; the impact on the individual and/or organization associated with the existing name or; the cost and impact of changing the existing signage, rebuilding community recognition and updating records (data bases, letterhead, promotional materials, etc.). All renaming requests must be submitted in the same format as listed in the section SUBMISSION PROCESS. Where a name/renaming change is recommended, a communication strategy will be initiated by advertising the proposed change on the Cityâ€™s website and Civic Corner for a period of 30 days during which time, public comments will be received and considered. Additionally, the costs associated with the naming/renaming initiative will be the responsibility of the City when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the City and will be the responsibility of the individual and/or organization when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the individual and/or organization.

Usage Les toponymes dont lâ€™usage est le mieux Ã©tabli doivent avoir prioritÃ© sâ€™ils ne dÃ©rogent pas Ã  dâ€™autres critÃ¨res. Dans les cas dâ€™usages parallÃ¨les et Ã©galement rÃ©pandus, on accorde la prÃ©fÃ©rence aux noms qui rÃ©pondent le mieux aux autres critÃ¨res. Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique Lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique est en franÃ§ais. Toutefois, en ce qui concerne les entitÃ©s naturelles, la langue du gÃ©nÃ©rique peut ne pas Ãªtre franÃ§aise si lâ€™importance du lieu dÃ©signÃ© est locale et si le nom de ce lieu est en usage exclusivement dans cette langue autre que franÃ§aise. Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique Sauf exception justifiable, il est de rÃ¨gle de conserver dans leur langue les mots de la langue gÃ©nÃ©rale quâ€™un usage local a consacrÃ©s, en particulier si leur utilisation prÃ©sente un intÃ©rÃªt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. On officialise dans leur langue dâ€™origine les spÃ©cifiques des toponymes amÃ©rindiens et inuits. Pour leur part, les points cardinaux inclus dans les odonymes et qui renseignent sur lâ€™identitÃ© dâ€™un tronÃ§on par rapport Ã  un autre ou sur la direction de la voie sont en franÃ§ais. Dans les cas dâ€™usages concurrents dâ€™une forme franÃ§aise et dâ€™une forme dans une autre langue, le ComitÃ© privilÃ©gie la premiÃ¨re si lâ€™usage local en est significatif. Par ailleurs, les mots de la langue gÃ©nÃ©rale qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes crÃ©Ã©s par le ComitÃ© sont en franÃ§ais. PrÃ©sence et unitÃ© du gÃ©nÃ©rique Un nom dâ€™entitÃ© naturelle ou artificielle comporte habituellement un gÃ©nÃ©rique. Un odonyme en comprend toujours un. Un nom dâ€™entitÃ© administrative peut en comporter lorsque le lieu dÃ©signÃ© nâ€™est pas une Ville, un autre lieu habitÃ© ou un lieu-dit. Cependant, un nom gÃ©ographique ne peut comprendre plus dâ€™un terme exerÃ§ant la fonction dâ€™un gÃ©nÃ©rique. Utilisation de gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes Les noms dâ€™entitÃ©s administratives et les noms nouveaux de voies de communication doivent prÃ©senter des gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes aux avis terminologiques. Les gÃ©nÃ©riques des noms attribuÃ©s Ã  des entitÃ©s naturelles innommÃ©es peuvent Ãªtre diffÃ©rents des termes consacrÃ©s par les avis terminologiques dans une volontÃ© de promotion de la langue franÃ§aise du QuÃ©bec en tant quâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment du patrimoine, de renforcement de lâ€™image suggÃ©rÃ©e par le lieu lui-mÃªme, de meilleure intÃ©gration du toponyme crÃ©Ã© aux Ã©lÃ©ments gÃ©nÃ©riques prÃ©sents dans le milieu ou encore afin de respecter un usage historique. Noms de personnes vivantes ou dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©es depuis moins dâ€™un an Un lieu peut se voir attribuer un nom commÃ©moratif dâ€™aprÃ¨s celui dâ€™une personne vivante et ayant une importance historique certaine ou un lien Ã©troit avec le lieu Ã  dÃ©signer. Seuls les noms de personnes dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©es depuis plus dâ€™un an peuvent faire lâ€™objet d'une officialisation auprÃ¨s de la Commission de Toponymie du QuÃ©bec. Utilisation dâ€™un nom dÃ©jÃ  officiel Lorsquâ€™on utilise un toponyme officiel ou lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique dâ€™un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte intÃ©gralement la forme. Utilisation dâ€™un nom de rue en lien avec le lieu Ã  commÃ©morer Certains noms facilitent le ""repÃ©rage"" de lieux par les citoyens et les visiteurs. Lorsque possible, le ComitÃ© doit sâ€™assurer, lors de lâ€™utilisation dâ€™un nom, quâ€™il existe un lien certain entre ce nom et son environnement immÃ©diat. Utilisation du mot ""Famille"" dans la dÃ©nomination La Ville nâ€™est pas favorable Ã  lâ€™utilisation du mot ""Famille"" dans la graphie dâ€™un nom. Utilisation de plusieurs prÃ©noms pour un mÃªme nom de famille La Ville n'est pas favorable Ã  l'utilisation d'un nom de famille avec divers prÃ©noms. Utilisation du nom de fille dâ€™une femme mariÃ©e Lâ€™utilisation pour une commÃ©moration du nom de fille dâ€™une femme mariÃ©e demeure une approche rÃ©pandue. Dans cette dÃ©marche les personnes honorÃ©es ne sont pas trÃ¨s connues ou seulement localement. Toutefois, lorsque certaines femmes sont de notoriÃ©tÃ© reconnue et utilisent le nom de famille de leur mari, câ€™est cette dÃ©signation qui devrait gÃ©nÃ©ralement Ãªtre retenue. Similitude quant Ã  lâ€™Ã©criture et la prononciation Lors de la fusion municipale de mars 2000, il avait Ã©tÃ© soulignÃ© le problÃ¨me de la coexistence de noms identiques ou prÃ©sentant des similitudes quant Ã  lâ€™Ã©criture et la prononciation, ce qui aurait pu engendrer des risques dâ€™erreurs et porter atteinte Ã  la sÃ©curitÃ© de la population. Encore aujourdâ€™hui, le choix de nouvelles dÃ©nominations doit tenir compte de ce facteur. Utilisation de lâ€™initiale La Ville nâ€™est pas favorable Ã  lâ€™utilisation de lâ€™initiale du prÃ©nom dâ€™un personnage Ã  commÃ©morer. Voie de circulation limitrophe entre deux zones rÃ©sidentielles Une voie de circulation, qui divise deux zones rÃ©sidentielles limitrophes dont les thÃ©matiques sont diffÃ©rentes, peut recevoir un nom sans lien direct avec l'une ou l'autre des deux thÃ©matiques. ImpartialitÃ© de la Ville Dâ€™un point de vue toponymique, la Ville doit demeurer impartiale face aux organismes militants, quâ€™il sâ€™agisse de groupes religieux, politiques ou autres. En tant que corps municipal au service de tous les citoyens, la Ville doit faire preuve de neutralitÃ© pour ne pas donner lâ€™impression quâ€™elle privilÃ©gie un groupe au dÃ©triment dâ€™un autre, ni nâ€™endosse de positions politiques ou religieuses dÃ©fendues par des groupes dâ€™intÃ©rÃªt. Nombre de commÃ©moration pour une personne De faÃ§on gÃ©nÃ©rale, la Ville honore une seule fois une mÃªme personne. Il peut arriver que seul le nom de famille soit utilisÃ© pour honorer cette personne. Dans ce cas, le nom au complet ne pourrait Ãªtre repris, car la commÃ©moration existe dÃ©jÃ .",Appplication form: https://www.ville.farnham.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Politique-de-denomination-toponymique.pdf,alevesque@ville.farnham.qc.ca,45.283333,-72.983333
Ontario_Orangeville,,,Orangeville,Ontario,Yes,"Criteria for Street Names 

 

The following criteria will be used for the selection of names to be added to the approved list of street names: 

 

Historical names that are proposed must be researched and recommended by Heritage Orangeville.  The Town crest would accompany the name on the street sign to indicate its historical nature. 

Names of Orangeville residents who died in action during World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and Afghanistan, as provided by the Royal Canadian Legion, will be considered.  A poppy would accompany the name on the street sign to identify that the street was named in honour of a veteran. 

Names of Orangeville residents who served and returned home during World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and Afghanistan, as provided by the Royal Canadian Legion and Honours Committee, will be considered.  A poppy would accompany the name on the street sign to identify that the street was named in honour of a veteran. 

Names of former mayors, reeves and councillors. 

Only surnames will be considered. 

Submission of Street Names for Approval 

 

Any names submitted for a proposed development which are not on the approved list will be subject to review by the Planning Department to ensure compliance with four criteria: 

 

Duplication - The proposed street name must not be a direct duplication of a street name within the Town boundaries or in the surrounding townships. 

 

Pronunciation - The proposed street name must not be difficult to pronounce or be a name that can be pronounced in a number of different ways. 

 

Spelling - The proposed street name must not be a name that is difficult to spell or be a name that can be spelled in a number of different ways. 

 

Similar Sounding - The proposed street name must not sound similar to existing street names within the Town boundaries or in the surrounding municipalities as this may cause confusion in emergency calls. 

 

The names will then be circulated to external public bodies/agencies for their review.  

 

Street Naming Theme â€“ Subdivision 

 

Where a particular theme for a proposed subdivision is contemplated, a developer/owner will not be required to select at least 50% of the proposed street names from the approved list.  Instead, a developer/owner will be required to submit the requested theme and corresponding street names to the Planning Department for their review. 

 

The theme and suggested street names will be circulated to the County, emergency services, and other external public bodies/agencies for comment, and then forwarded to Council for approval. ","Approved Names List added to OneDrive

Quebec_Bromont,,,Bromont,Quebec,Yes,"4. CHAMPS Dâ€™APPLICATION La prÃ©sente Politique sâ€™applique Ã  toute demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique et toute question relative Ã  la toponymie, quelle quâ€™en soit la nature et la provenance, incluant celles initiÃ©es par les diffÃ©rentes instances de la Ville de Bromont. Le territoire pour lequel le ComitÃ© de toponymie doit exercer sa mission est celui de la Ville de Bromont. Les lieux Ã  nommer sont : - Les voies de communication publiques ou privÃ©es (rues, chemins, etc.); - Les parcs et espaces verts publics; - Les Ã©difices publics et les salles publiques Ã  lâ€™intÃ©rieur de ces Ã©difices; - Les Ã©quipements sportifs ou culturels publics; - Tous les autres lieux ou espaces publics. 5. PROCÃ‰DURE DE DÃ‰NOMINATION TOPONYMIQUE 5.1 DÃ©pÃ´t dâ€™une demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique Une demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique peut notamment Ãªtre prÃ©sentÃ©e par un citoyen, un groupe de personnes ou un organisme ou Ãªtre initiÃ©e par les diffÃ©rentes instances de la Ville de Bromont. Le requÃ©rant a la responsabilitÃ© de fournir toutes les informations relatives au toponyme proposÃ© nÃ©cessaire Ã  lâ€™analyse de sa demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique. 5.2 Analyse et recommandation du ComitÃ© de toponymie Le ComitÃ© de toponymie analyse la demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique soumise en fonction des critÃ¨res dâ€™analyse et de choix des noms des lieux Ã©tablis dans la prÃ©sente Politique et formule une recommandation par Ã©crit au conseil municipal. Ã€ noter que dans le cas dâ€™une recommandation favorable, le ComitÃ© de toponymie demande prÃ©alablement un avis technique Ã  la Commission de toponymie, afin de sâ€™assurer du respect des rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture Ã©tablies par la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. 5.3 DÃ©cision du conseil municipal Le conseil municipal reÃ§oit et analyse la recommandation du ComitÃ© de toponymie (en fonction des critÃ¨res dâ€™analyse et de choix des noms des lieux Ã©tablis dans la prÃ©sente Politique). Par la suite, le conseil municipal adopte une rÃ©solution par laquelle ce dernier accepte ou refuse la demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique. 5.4 Suivi des dÃ©cisions du conseil municipal Dans le cas dâ€™un refus de la demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique par le conseil municipal, le ComitÃ© de toponymie en informe le requÃ©rant et ferme la demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique. Dans le cas dâ€™une acceptation de la demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique par le conseil municipal, le ComitÃ© de toponymie transmet la rÃ©solution (et tout autre document jugÃ© nÃ©cessaire et pertinent Ã  la demande) Ã  la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec en vue de demander lâ€™officialisation du toponyme auprÃ¨s de la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. 5.5 Liste des noms de lieux En tout temps, le ComitÃ© de toponymie sâ€™assure de gÃ©rer et de tenir Ã  jour une banque de noms pour de futures dÃ©nominations toponymiques. 

6. CRITÃˆRES Dâ€™ANALYSE Lâ€™analyse du choix des noms des lieux se fait selon les critÃ¨res suivants : Normes gÃ©nÃ©rales 1. UnicitÃ© du nom de lieu : Tout lieu se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel; 2. Usage : Les toponymes dont lâ€™usage populaire est le mieux Ã©tabli doivent avoir prioritÃ© sâ€™ils ne dÃ©rogent pas Ã  dâ€™autres critÃ¨res. Dans le cas dâ€™usages parallÃ¨les et Ã©galement rÃ©pandus, on accorde la prÃ©fÃ©rence aux noms qui rÃ©pondent le mieux aux autres critÃ¨res; 3. Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique : Lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique est en franÃ§ais; 4. Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique : Les mots de la langue gÃ©nÃ©rale qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes sont en franÃ§ais.Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue dâ€™origine les mots dâ€™une langue autre que le franÃ§ais quâ€™un usage local a consacrÃ©s, en particulier si leur utilisation prÃ©sente un intÃ©rÃªt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visÃ©s par cette rÃ¨gle et sont Ã©crits dans leur forme originale. Les points cardinaux inclus dans les noms de voies de communication (odonymes) qui renseignent sur la localisation dâ€™un tronÃ§on par rapport Ã  un autre ou sur la direction de la voie sont en franÃ§ais; 5. PrÃ©sence et unicitÃ© du gÃ©nÃ©rique : Un nom dâ€™entitÃ© naturelle ou artificielle comporte habituellement un gÃ©nÃ©rique. Un odonyme comporte toujours un gÃ©nÃ©rique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus dâ€™un terme exerÃ§ant la fonction de gÃ©nÃ©rique; 6. Utilisation de gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes : Les lieux et odonymes doivent prÃ©senter des gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de lâ€™Office quÃ©bÃ©cois de la langue franÃ§aise); 7. Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©es depuis moins dâ€™un an : Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom dâ€™une personne vivante ou dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©e depuis moins dâ€™un an. Le nom proposÃ© rend hommage Ã  une personnalitÃ© qui a apportÃ© une contribution significative au dÃ©veloppement, au dynamisme ou au bien-Ãªtre de la communautÃ© de la Ville de Bromont; 8. Utilisation dâ€™un nom dÃ©jÃ  officiel : Lorsquâ€™on utilise un toponyme officiel ou lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique dâ€™un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte la forme, moyennant lâ€™ajout de majuscules et de traits dâ€™union en fonction des rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture toponymiques; 

Sources inspirantes recommandÃ©es 9. Ressources historiques et folkloriques du milieu : Pour la dÃ©signation de lieux, il convient de sâ€™inspirer des faits des Ã©vÃ©nements et des personnages historiques ou folkloriques qui ont marquÃ© la vie locale ou rÃ©gionale; 10. Ressources de la gÃ©ographie : La dÃ©nomination de lieux tire avantage de sâ€™inspirer des caractÃ©ristiques du milieu naturel environnant (flore, faune, gÃ©ologie, etc.); 11. PrÃ©servation des rÃ©gionalismes : Il importe dâ€™accorder un soin particulier Ã  la prÃ©servation des rÃ©gionalismes dans la toponymie; 12. DÃ©signations commÃ©moratives : Des personnes, des organismes, des collectivitÃ©s ou des Ã©vÃ©nements peuvent faire lâ€™objet de dÃ©signations commÃ©moratives sâ€™ils ont jouÃ© un rÃ´le important pour la communautÃ© quÃ©bÃ©coise; 13. Noms de personnes : Lorsquâ€™on honore la mÃ©moire dâ€™une personne par lâ€™attribution de son nom Ã  un lieu, on devrait privilÃ©gier le nom sous lequel elle est la mieux connue; il peut sâ€™agir dâ€™un nom complet ou dâ€™une forme usuelle. Le choix de lâ€™anthroponyme commÃ©moratif doit permettre dâ€™identifier correctement la personne honorÃ©e. On sâ€™efforce gÃ©nÃ©ralement de retenir le nom complet de la personne (prÃ©nom(s) et nom de famille); 

Pratiques contre-indiquÃ©es 14. DÃ©signations pÃ©joratives, grossiÃ¨res ou suscitant la dissension : On doit Ã©viter lâ€™emploi de noms Ã  connotation pÃ©jorative ou grossiÃ¨re, de mÃªme que les choix susceptibles de provoquer ou dâ€™alimenter une dissension; 15. Noms banals ou utilisÃ©s frÃ©quemment : On doit Ã©viter lâ€™emploi de noms trop banals et ceux dont lâ€™existence est largement rÃ©pandue. Certains noms servent Ã  dÃ©signer un grand nombre dâ€™entitÃ©s gÃ©ographiques diffÃ©rentes et leur rÃ©pÃ©tition peut Ãªtre source de confusion. Dans toute recherche en vue de lâ€™attribution dâ€™un nom Ã  un lieu innommÃ©, il convient de sâ€™inspirer davantage des donnÃ©es historiques locales et des diffÃ©rentes particularitÃ©s morphologiques, biologiques ou autres du milieu en faisant preuve dâ€™originalitÃ©, afin dâ€™Ã©viter dâ€™ajouter Ã  la prolifÃ©ration de noms frÃ©quemment utilisÃ©s et rendus banals; 16. DÃ©signations publicitaires : On doit Ã©viter dâ€™attribuer des noms qui peuvent servir de rÃ©clame Ã  des marques de commerce ou Ã  des entreprises commerciales ou industrielles; 17. DÃ©signations numÃ©riques, alphabÃ©tiques et alphanumÃ©riques : Il faut Ã©viter dâ€™utiliser des nombres et des lettres comme base de dÃ©nomination des lieux. Cependant, le cas Ã©chÃ©ant, il convient dâ€™utiliser la forme ordinale (lâ€™adjectif numÃ©ral) plutÃ´t que la forme cardinale (le nombre pur); 18. Points cardinaux : Lâ€™utilisation de points cardinaux est Ã  Ã©viter, Ã  moins quâ€™ils ne dÃ©signent de faÃ§on prÃ©cise une entitÃ© ou quâ€™ils ne fassent partie dâ€™un toponyme existant. Pour former de nouveaux toponymes, on peut bien sÃ»r utiliser des toponymes qui en comportent dÃ©jÃ ; 19. Juxtaposition de toponymes : On devrait Ã©viter de crÃ©er des toponymes en juxtaposant des spÃ©cifiques toponymiques ou des toponymes entiers si cela est de nature Ã  produire des noms gÃ©ographiques dont la longueur rend leur utilisation difficile; 

Autres : 20. Doublon et homonyme : Deux lieux ne doivent pas porter le mÃªme nom ni un nom semblable, dans le but dâ€™Ã©viter la redondance et le risque de confusion engendrÃ©s par lâ€™existence de doublons et dâ€™homonymes, Ã  lâ€™exception des lieux contigus; 21. AmbiguÃ¯tÃ© : Toute ambiguÃ¯tÃ© dans la dÃ©nomination doit Ãªtre Ã©vitÃ©e afin dâ€™assurer la sÃ©curitÃ© reliÃ©e Ã  la recherche dâ€™une adresse civique pour les services dâ€™urgence (ambulancier, policier, pompier, etc.); 22. Remplacement dâ€™un nom par un autre : Dans le cas oÃ¹ se prÃ©sente une suggestion de remplacement dâ€™un nom par un autre, le statu quo doit Ãªtre privilÃ©giÃ©, Ã  moins quâ€™une dÃ©monstration claire ne soit faite indiquant que le changement comporte de grands avantages, quâ€™il est sans prÃ©judice pour autrui et quâ€™il a une valeur patrimoniale ou historique; 23. CaractÃ¨re logique de la dÃ©nomination : Il existe un lien pertinent entre le toponyme proposÃ© et le lieu Ã  nommer. Dans le cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronÃ§ons devraient autant que possible porter le nom des tronÃ§ons existants; 24. Sentiment dâ€™appartenance : Le nom proposÃ© est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment dâ€™appartenance Ã  la Ville de Bromont. Il met en valeur lâ€™identitÃ© bromontoise, le patrimoine et lâ€™histoire locale les lieux dâ€™appartenance; 25. ReprÃ©sentativitÃ© des femmes : Le nom proposÃ© vise Ã  amÃ©liorer la reprÃ©sentativitÃ© des femmes dans la toponymie bromontoise, en tenant notamment compte de lâ€™importance et de la superficie du lieu nommÃ©; 26. ThÃ©matique : Le choix ou le maintien dâ€™une thÃ©matique spÃ©cifique est favorisÃ© pour un secteur ou partie de secteur dans la dÃ©nomination des nouvelles rues et des parcs et espaces verts. 27. RÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture : Les rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture Ã©tablies par la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec doivent Ãªtre respectÃ©es; ",N/A,ville@bromont.com,45.316667,-72.65

Quebec_Dolbeau-Mistassini,,,Dolbeau-Mistassini,Quebec,Yes,"3. Naming of public buildings and major infrastructure 

Specific eligibility conditions: 

The municipal council may name or rename certain public buildings, major municipal infrastructures or certain thoroughfares: 

3.1. In honor of a person: 

Having distinguished himself on the local, regional or national political scene as a deputy or elected municipal official; 

Having been deceased for at least two years; 

Having marked the local history by his personal or professional achievements, by the realization of a major project or the defense of a particular cause or for having played a particular role in a higher government; 

Not already the subject of another toponymic commemoration by the City of Dolbeau-Mistassini. 

3.2. In memory of an event that will have greatly marked the community. 

In the event that a traffic lane is subject to a name change, the modifications should be announced at least two years in advance to limit the impacts. 

4. Parks and green spaces 

Specific eligibility conditions: 

The municipal council may name or rename its parks and green spaces: 

4.1. In honor of a person: 

Having stood out on the local scene by carrying out a major project or defending a cause that is particularly important to the community; 

Having been deceased for at least two years. 

4.2. In memory of an event that will have greatly marked the community. 

In the case of certain parks or spaces whose name is associated with local organizations, any changes must be made in collaboration with the organizations concerned. 

The City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will allow citizens at any time to submit nominations to honor new personalities based on the criteria of this category. 

Process and general eligibility 

The program has five categories for which criteria are defined. 

1. Enhancement of current names 
2. New developments 
3. Naming of public buildings and major infrastructures 
4. Parks and green spaces 
5. Forecourt of starry blueberries 

In all cases, it is the municipal council that makes the decision to rename a building, an infrastructure, a green space or any other place under its jurisdiction. The latter may consult the community and, when applicable, must formalize its procedures with the Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. As soon as it is adopted in 2017, the City will provide citizens with web forms to suggest the candidacy of new personalities for categories 4 and 5. 

With regard to categories 3, 4 and 5, each toponymic recognition or commemoration action will be accompanied by a civic reception and the signing of the City's guestbook. In addition, the City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will take steps to allow citizens to have access to the biography of the personalities thus honored, in particular by posting them in the Bank of Place Names of QuÃ©bec, on the site of the Commission de toponymie. 

General eligibility requirements: 

To be eligible for any category of this program, a person must be considered a Dolmissoise or a Dolmissois. For the purposes of this document, a Dolmissoise is a person born in Dolbeau-Mistassini, who has lived there or who has evolved within a local group for at least 10 years. 

Category of interventions 

1. Highlighting current names 

Several streets in Dolbeau-Mistassini already bear names reflecting the history of the city. The first category of this program will consist of highlighting current odonyms, thanks to the collaboration of the Maria-Chapdelaine History and Genealogy Society. 

The City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will therefore take the following measures: 

Formalize the origin of the names of thoroughfares with the Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec and ensure their distribution in the Bank of place names of QuÃ©bec. 

Allow the History and Genealogy Society to publish and sell a guide listing all the odonyms of the city of Dolbeau-Mistassini. 

To consult the list of official toponyms in Dolbeau-Mistassini, consult the website of the Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec .  

2. New developments 

When the previously developed urban planning logic allows it, the choice of street names for new developments gives preponderance to the pioneers of Dolbeau-Mistassini who contributed in its beginnings to founding the former towns of Dolbeau and Mistassini, and this , more precisely between 1892 and 1950. The toponymic proposals provided by the Maria-Chapdelaine Historical and Genealogical Society are mainly used as a reference for this category.

Quebec_Coaticook,,,Coaticook,Quebec,Yes,"1.2 Objectifs La prÃ©sente politique vise Ã  : ïƒ˜ Mettre en valeur lâ€™histoire et le patrimoine de la Ville de Coaticook par la dÃ©nomination de ses rues, de ses routes, de ses chemins, de ses bÃ¢timents, de ses lieux et de toute autre entitÃ© gÃ©ographique; ïƒ˜ Ã‰liminer toute ambiguÃ¯tÃ© dans la dÃ©nomination afin dâ€™assurer la sÃ©curitÃ© reliÃ©e Ã  la recherche dâ€™une adresse civique pour divers services (ambulancier, policier, incendie, etc.). ïƒ˜ DÃ©velopper le sentiment dâ€™appartenance des citoyens par la dÃ©nomination; ïƒ˜ Ã‰tablir une dÃ©marche respectueuse avant de procÃ©der Ã  une dÃ©nomination. 

4.0 PROCÃ‰DURE Toute requÃªte de dÃ©nomination reÃ§ue par la Ville de Coaticook est acheminÃ©e au comitÃ© de toponymie. Le comitÃ© de toponymie analyse la demande et transmet, au besoin, sa recommandation au conseil municipal. Dans le cas dâ€™une dÃ©cision favorable par ce dernier, la rÃ©solution est transmise Ã  la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec, qui officialise la nomination. Celle-ci entre en vigueur lors de la rÃ©ception dâ€™une rÃ©ponse dâ€™officialisation de la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. La Ville achemine alors lâ€™information aux services concernÃ©s (urbanisme, travaux publics, communication, culture, Poste Canada) Si la proposition ne peut Ãªtre attribuÃ©e Ã  court terme, elle est alors insÃ©rÃ©e Ã  la banque de noms. 5.0 RÃˆGLES DE DÃ‰NOMINATION Avant de choisir un nom pour un lieu donnÃ©, les aspects suivants sont examinÃ©s : ïƒ˜ La nature du lieu : voie, parc, place publique ou immeuble; ïƒ˜ les qualitÃ©s du lieu Ã  nommer : sa fonction, sa localisation gÃ©ographique et son contexte, quâ€™il soit rÃ©sidentiel, commercial, industriel ou culturel; ïƒ˜ lâ€™histoire du quartier sur les plans urbain et social; ïƒ˜ la toponymie existante : afin dâ€™Ã©viter les doublons ou homonymes, et dâ€™harmoniser les nouvelles dÃ©signations avec le patrimoine toponymique du secteur; ïƒ˜ le profil biographique de la personne dont la mÃ©moire est honorÃ©e; ïƒ˜ lâ€™importance de certains Ã©vÃ©nements et leur impact social; ïƒ˜ lâ€™association naturelle entre la personne, la communautÃ© rÃ©sidante concernÃ©e et le lieu Ã  nommer 5.1 CritÃ¨res fondamentaux La politique de dÃ©signation toponymique et odonymique doit permettre dâ€™identifier le meilleur choix de toponymes en sâ€™appuyant sur certains critÃ¨res fondamentaux soit : ïƒ˜ Ã‰viter les dÃ©nominations dÃ©pourvues de tout contenu culturel ; ïƒ˜ Tenir compte du contenu enrichissant quâ€™offre les noms issus de lâ€™histoire et du patrimoine local ou national ; ïƒ˜ Ã‰viter le choix dâ€™un nom dont lâ€™attribution pourrait provoquer une controverse ; ïƒ˜ Ã‰viter les noms Ã  consonance semblable (homonyme) ou doublons qui pourrait confondre le repÃ©rage par les services dâ€™urgence ; ïƒ˜ Faciliter le repÃ©rage du lieu nommÃ© ; ïƒ˜ Honorer une seule fois une mÃªme personne ; ïƒ˜ Exclure les noms de personnes vivantes ou dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©es depuis moins dâ€™un an ; ïƒ˜ Attribuer un seul nom officiel Ã  tout lieu ou entitÃ© gÃ©ographique. 

5.2 CritÃ¨res spÃ©cifiques Pour la dÃ©nomination des voies de communication (rue, chemin, sentiers) ainsi que des Ã©difices municipaux, places publiques ou monuments, il est important que lâ€™attribution dâ€™un nom soit reprÃ©sentative du milieu historique, culturel ou communautaire. Ainsi, il est recommandÃ© de fixer le choix sur les critÃ¨res suivants : ïƒ˜ Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particuliÃ¨rement illustrÃ©es au sein de leur communautÃ© ; ïƒ˜ Favoriser le nom des pionniers qui ont bÃ¢ti la municipalitÃ© ; ïƒ˜ Favoriser le nom de lâ€™ancÃªtre dâ€™une famille ancienne ; ïƒ˜ Favoriser le nom dâ€™une personnalitÃ© publique qui a apportÃ© une contribution exceptionnelle au dÃ©veloppement de la ville ; ïƒ˜ Ã‰viter la nomination dÃ©signant seulement la fonction de lâ€™Ã©difice. Pour la dÃ©signation des parcs et espaces verts municipaux, dont les principaux utilisateurs sont les gens du milieu environnant, il convient de suivre les critÃ¨res suivants: ïƒ˜ PremiÃ¨rement, donner le nom de la rue adjacente au parc pour permettre un meilleure repÃ©rage de celui-ci par les usagers ; ïƒ˜ DeuxiÃ¨mement, favoriser le nom de lâ€™ancÃªtre dâ€™une famille ancienne ayant habitÃ© dans le secteur concernÃ© ou ; ïƒ˜ Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particuliÃ¨rement illustrÃ©es au sein de leur communautÃ© dans le secteur visÃ©, ou dans la municipalitÃ©.

La Commission de toponymie est lâ€™organisme responsable de la gestion des noms de lieux du Québec. MISSION Sâ€™assurer que le territoire du Québec est nommé avec justesse et quâ€™il met en valeur le visage fran§ais du Québec. MANDAT Créée en 1977 en vertu de la Charte de la langue fran§aise, la Commission doit : â€¢ proposer au gouvernement les normes et les r¨gles dâ€™écriture   respecter dans la dénomination des lieux; â€¢ procéder   lâ€™inventaire et   la conservation des noms de lieux; â€¢ établir et normaliser la terminologie géographique, en collaboration avec lâ€™Office québécois de la langue fran§aise; â€¢ officialiser les noms de lieux; â€¢ diffuser la nomenclature géographique officielle du Québec; â€¢ donner son avis au gouvernement sur toute question que celui-ci lui soumet en mati¨re de toponymie.

Le comité consultatif d'urbanisme de la Ville de Gaspé est formé de deux élus municipaux et de sept membres non élus choisis dans la communauté et provenant de secteurs géographiques, sociaux, économiques différents et complémentaires. De plus, certaines personnes ressources assistent le comité dans leurs travaux (directeur de lâ€™Urbanisme, inspecteurs, aménagiste, etc.). Le comité consultatif dâ€™urbanisme, en collaboration avec la direction de lâ€™Urbanisme de la Ville de Gaspé, est responsable de lâ€™application de la politique de dénomination toponymique de la Ville de Gaspé et du comité de toponymie.

5.2 REMPLACEMENT Dâ€™UN NOM PAR UN AUTRE Dans le cas o¹ se présenterait une suggestion de remplacement dâ€™un nom par un autre, le statu quo devrait ªtre privilégié,   moins quâ€™une démonstration claire ne soit présentée au comité de toponymie   lâ€™effet que le changement comporte de grands avantages, sans préjudice pour autrui. Le remplacement dâ€™un nom commun par un nom propre sera privilégié plut´t que lâ€™inverse.

Quebec_Carleton-sir-Mer,,,Carleton-sir-Mer,Quebec,Yes,"1. Contexte et fondements 

€ la suite de la fusion de la Ville de Carleton avec la municipalité de Saint-Omer, la nouvelle entité, la ville de Carleton-sur-Mer, constate la nécessité de se doter dâ€™une politique pour la dénomination de ses rues, de ses routes, de ses chemins, de ses b¢timents, de ses lieux et places publiques ou de toute autre entité géographique. 

La Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer abrite une multitude de rues, de places publiques et dâ€™édifices qui sont désignés par une appellation les différenciant les uns des autres. Ces différentes appellations portent le nom de toponyme, terme utilisé pour désigner les noms des entités géographiques de la municipalité. 

La Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer est appelée   cro®tre au cours des prochaines années. € cet effet, de nouveaux projets de construction résidentielle et commerciale verront le jour. De plus, la Ville re§oit réguli¨rement des demandes de citoyens qui désirent attribuer un nom   une entité qui nâ€™en poss¨de pas ou proposer des appellations pour des entités futures. Enfin, lâ€™existence de plusieurs doublons dans les noms de rues est lâ€™une des premi¨res raisons qui motive la municipalité   revoir lâ€™ensemble de la dénomination   lâ€™intérieur dâ€™une politique qui tient compte de ce qui caractérise le milieu. 

Dans le but de pouvoir gérer efficacement lâ€™ensemble du dossier toponymique, la Corporation de lâ€™‰comusée Tracadi¨che et le directeur du développement culturel   la Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer ont élaboré la présente politique dont la mise en place est destinée   améliorer la méthodologie en mati¨re de dénomination au sein de la municipalité. 

5. Mandats du directeur du développement culturel et de lâ€™‰comusée Tracadi¨che 

Â· Formuler des avis toponymiques adressés aux instances concernées; 

Â· Coordonner la gestion et la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles; 

Â· Verser les appellations retenues dans la banque de noms disponibles et refuser les noms jugés invalides ; 

Â· Coordonner les actions (recherche, etc.) nécessaires   la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles; 

Â· Consulter la population en cas de besoin, en collaboration avec les instances municipales, pour obtenir des suggestions de toponymes et conna®tre les préférences des citoyens; 

Â· Assurer le bon fonctionnement des prises de décisions en tenant   jour la documentation justifiant la prise de décisions. 

6. Processus 

6.1 Lorsquâ€™elle le juge nécessaire, la Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer entend nommer ses rues, ses routes, ses chemins, ses lieux et toute autre entité géographique de la fa§on suivante : 

Â· En rendant un hommage posthume   un citoyen décédé depuis au moins un an et qui a grandement contribué, par son action, au développement du milieu et de la communauté; 

Â· En rendant un hommage posthume   un personnage considéré comme un fondateur ou un pionnier; 

Â· En utilisant un fait historique qui relate une période ou un événement en relation avec lâ€™histoire de la communauté ou de la région; 

Â· En utilisant un toponyme ou un paysage exclusif au milieu. 

6.2 Le Conseil de Ville consulte son directeur du service culturel et lâ€™‰comusée Tracadi¨che avant de procéder   une dénomination. 

6.3 La proposition toponymique est effectuée par les membres de lâ€™‰comusée Tracadi¨che et le directeur du développement culturel. Un dossier est ouvert pour chaque demande ou proposition. Dans tous les cas, la recommandation doit ªtre accompagnée dâ€™une argumentation justifiant le choix du nom. 

6.4 La préparation dâ€™un dossier accompagne chaque proposition. Lâ€™exercice consiste   rassembler le plus de documentation possible   propos du nom proposé. Ces renseignements serviront   justifier la proposition toponymique. Cette étape du processus de dénomination toponymique a pour but dâ€™évaluer la valeur toponymique du nom proposé et dâ€™en déterminer la validation   l'aide de crit¨res précis. 

6.5 Un rapport est rédigé puis déposé au conseil municipal. Dans le cas o¹ il jugerait nécessaire quâ€™une consultation publique soit faite, il le signifie   lâ€™‰comusée Tracadi¨che et au directeur du développement culturel qui sâ€™en chargent. 

6.6 Un délai raisonnable sera accordé   lâ€™‰comusée Tracadi¨che pour faire une recommandation documentée en fonction des différents param¨tres de la présente politique. 

6.7 Le directeur général et greffier fait ensuite valider le ou les noms retenus aupr¨s de la commission toponymique du Québec. Cette validation officialise lâ€™usage des noms   lâ€™échelle du Québec. 

7. Crit¨res dâ€™analyse 

7.1 Conformité aux crit¨res de choix, aux r¨gles d'écriture et aux autres politiques : 

Les désignations commémoratives doivent se faire conformément aux crit¨res de choix, aux r¨gles d'écriture et aux autres politiques de la Commission de toponymie. 

7.2 Choix non controversé 

Le choix du lieu et du nom devant faire l'objet de commémoration (personne, organisme, collectivité, événement ou Å“uvre) ne doit pas ªtre de nature   susciter la controverse. 

7.3 Ancienneté du nom : 

Le nom proposé   un caract¨re historique ou patrimonial, fait notamment référence   une personne ou un événement de notre histoire. 

7.4 Caract¨re logique de la désignation : 

Existence dâ€™un lien pertinent entre le nom proposé et le lieu   nommer dans le respect des thématiques existantes sâ€™il y a lieu. 

7.5 Sentiment d'appartenance : 

Le nom proposé est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment dâ€™appartenance   la ville de Carleton-sur-Mer. Il met en valeur lâ€™identité acadienne, les lieux dâ€™appartenance, la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que le caract¨re francophone de la ville. ",N/A,pascal.alain@carletonsurmer.com,,

Ontario_Meaford,,,Meaford,Ontario,Yes,"Policy Statement The Municipality of Meaford has deemed it appropriate to establish a protocol for naming streets, parks and municipal facilities. The policy will ensure that naming opportunities are dealt with in a consistent manner. In this regard, the Street, Park and Municipal Facility Naming Policy establishes guidelines regarding naming and the establishment of an â€œApproved Name Listâ€. Purpose This policy provides guidance on the method of street, park and municipal facility naming within the Municipality of Meaford. The function of naming is to enable people, and emergency services, to locate properties readily. This policy will be applied in conjunction with the civic numbering policy developed in conjunction with the County of Grey which utilizes a six digit number for rural properties and a three digit number for rural subdivisions. 

Policy Requirements General Policies for Appropriate Names The following criteria will be considered for potential naming of streets, parks and facilities: Names Honouring Those Who Have Served or Given their Life in Public Service The Municipality will facilitate the naming of streets, parks and facilities after residents of the municipality who have lost their lives while serving within the Armed Forces. In addition, the Municipality may also include the name of those who lose their lives in the service of the public through either the Ontario Provincial Police or the Fire Department with the written consent of his/her immediate family. Special signage containing the Poppy symbol is to be used for all Veteran street, park and facility names. Names Honouring Individuals for Community Service, Local Historical Reasons, National Reasons or International Reasons Council may approve, upon request by an individual or proponent, a name for a street, park or facility which identifies a specific individual. Generally such a name will be of historic importance to the municipality or be a name which is of importance either nationally or internationally or lastly be a name of a person who has been of public service to the municipality or broader community. A written description of the individualâ€™s contribution to the municipality, or broader community explaining why the honour should be given, shall be submitted by the proponent. Staff shall research names proposed by Council. The written consent of his/her immediate family is required. Names that reflect the Municipalityâ€™s Agricultural and/or Heritage/Nature Council may approve, or a proponent may request the approval of, a name which reflects the municipalityâ€™s agricultural and/or heritage/nature. A written description of the proposed name and its linkage to the area shall be submitted by the proponent. Staff shall research names proposed by Council. Other Names Other appropriate names are those that promote pride in the municipality, acknowledge local heritage and history, and recognize unique features and geography. Proposed names should meet one of following: â€¢ Commemorate local history, places, events, culture. â€¢ Strengthen neighbourhood identity to reflect the character of the area. â€¢ Recognize native wildlife, flora, fauna, natural features. â€¢ Recognize communities that contribute to the public life of the Municipality. â€¢ Names that represent specific themes are encouraged as they are easily recognizable for emergency services and provide consistency in large developments. Priority for Selection of Names In assigning names, names from the â€œApproved Name Listâ€ should be used when selecting names for a proposed street, park or facility. The categories of this list are as follows: 1. Names Honouring Those Who Have Served Their Country 2. Names Honouring Those who have given their Life in Public Service 3. Names Honouring Individuals â€“ Local Historical 4. Names Honouring Individuals â€“ National or International 5. Names Honouring Individuals â€“ Community Service 6. Names that reflect the Municipalityâ€™s Agricultural and/or Recreational Heritage/Nature 7. Other Names Specific Policies regarding Suitability of Street Names When naming a new street, in addition to the General Policies as stated in the previous section, the following shall be adhered to ensure orderly naming of streets: Ease of Spelling and Pronunciation Street names shall be easily pronounced, recognized and use conventional spelling to avoid difficulties in emergency situations. Street names should be spelled the way they are pronounced. Individuals Streets named after individuals shall be a posthumously honour and Council shall consider such names provided that a written consent is obtained from the individualâ€™s surviving immediate family. A written description is required detailing how the individual made a significant contribution to the Municipality of Meaford. The honouring of a living public figure requires his/her written consent. Two Word Street Names Proposed street names consisting of two words shall be changed to one word. Only a personâ€™s last name shall be used unless additional identification is necessitated by the Municipality to prevent duplication with an existing street name in the municipality and surrounding local municipalities. Street Name Characteristics Names should generally not exceed ten characters in length. This helps ensure that the above mentioned criterion are met and that there is a standard street name signage across the municipality and county. Street Names to Avoid 1. Names that are in conflict with other street names within the Municipality or County of Grey. 2. Names that could be construed as advertising a particular business, product or brand. 3. Cumbersome, corrupted, modified names, discriminatory or derogatory names from the point of view of race, sex, colour, creed, political affiliation or other social factors. 4. Names with any sexual overtones, inappropriate humour, parody, slang or double meaning. 5. Names that have a secondary negative or offensive connotation. 6. Street names spelled differently but sound alike (i.e. Crosby Lane and Crosbie Lane) or have similar pronunciation but are spelled differently (i.e. Heirloom Street could be pronounced with â€˜Hâ€™ dropped (Eirloom Street)). 7. Use of complex words (ex. Quetico Drive). 8. Names with hyphens, apostrophes or dashes are discouraged and only considered on a case by case basis provided other criterion is met.

Câ€™est pourquoi lâ€™attribution de noms aux lieux est encadrÃ© par des rÃ¨gles bien Ã©tablies. Le second rÃ´le de la toponymie est dâ€™exprimer par des noms certains aspects de notre culture. Ã€ ce titre, la toponymie fait partie du patrimoine collectif. Le toponyme traduit une reconnaissance publique dâ€™une cause, de la mÃ©moire dâ€™un personnage ou dâ€™un Ã©vÃ©nement. Ainsi, le toponyme anime le lieu et cristallise le sentiment dâ€™appartenance Ã  la collectivitÃ©. 

Formuler des avis toponymiques ï‚· Obtenir tous les renseignements pertinents permettant une analyse et une dÃ©cision Ã©clairÃ©es; ï‚· Analyser, Ã  la lumiÃ¨re des informations recueillies, toutes les demandes toponymiques qui lui sont soumises; ï‚· Formuler des avis toponymiques au conseil municipal lorsque requis. Le ComitÃ© de la toponymie et du patrimoine a un pouvoir de recommandation en ce qui a trait Ã  lâ€™attribution de noms; ï‚· Recommander au conseil municipal le nom de tous les nouveaux sites publics construits par la Ville, incluant rues, parcs, bÃ¢timents, etc. Coordonner la gestion et la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles ï‚· Verser les appellations retenues dans la banque de noms disponibles et refuser les noms qui ne sont pas admissibles; ï‚· Coordonner les actions, recherches et ressources nÃ©cessaires Ã  la bonification de la banque; ï‚· SuggÃ©rer des toponymes et/ou des thÃ©matiques lors de dÃ©veloppement de nouvelles zones, lorsque requis; ï‚· Consulter la population, sur recommandation, afin dâ€™obtenir des suggestions de toponymes et de connaÃ®tre les prÃ©fÃ©rences des citoyens. Assurer le bon fonctionnement du ComitÃ© ï‚· Tenir Ã  jour toute la documentation justifiant les dÃ©cisions du ComitÃ©. 

DÃ©pÃ´t dâ€™une requÃªte ï‚· Toute personne qui dÃ©pose au ComitÃ© de la toponymie et du patrimoine une requÃªte de dÃ©nomination doit remplir le formulaire de proposition toponymique (accessible en ligne ou Ã  lâ€™hÃ´tel de ville). Le requÃ©rant a la responsabilitÃ© de procurer aux membres du ComitÃ© toute lâ€™information relative au nom proposÃ© et qui est nÃ©cessaire Ã  lâ€™analyse de sa demande. ï‚· Le ComitÃ© se rÃ©serve le droit de refuser ou de traiter toute demande pour laquelle un formulaire nâ€™a pas Ã©tÃ© rempli ou dont le formulaire ne fournit pas suffisamment de renseignements. ï‚· AprÃ¨s le dÃ©pÃ´t dâ€™une requÃªte, un accusÃ© de rÃ©ception est envoyÃ© au requÃ©rant pour lâ€™informer que sa demande sera traitÃ©e dans les meilleurs dÃ©lais lors de la prochaine rencontre du ComitÃ©. PrÃ©paration du dossier ï‚· Un dossier est ouvert par le ComitÃ© pour chaque demande soumise. ï‚· Le ComitÃ© compile le plus de renseignements possible Ã  propos du nom proposÃ©. Ces renseignements serviront Ã  lâ€™analyse de la proposition. Analyse de la requÃªte ï‚· Lâ€™analyse de la proposition toponymique est effectuÃ©e par les membres du ComitÃ© .

CritÃ¨res dâ€™analyse Dans son analyse, le ComitÃ© accorde une attention particuliÃ¨re aux critÃ¨res suivants : ï‚· ConformitÃ© aux critÃ¨res de choix de la Ville de Boisbriand (voir Annexe 1 â€“ Extrait du Guide toponymique municipal de la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec) Le nom proposÃ© est conforme aux critÃ¨res de choix Ã©laborÃ©s par la Ville selon les normes de la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. En cas de conflit entre les critÃ¨res de la Ville et ceux de la Commission, les critÃ¨res de la Commission ont prÃ©sÃ©ance. ï‚· AnciennetÃ© du nom Le nom proposÃ© a un caractÃ¨re historique ou patrimonial; il fait notamment rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  une personne ou Ã  un Ã©vÃ©nement de notre histoire. ï‚· CaractÃ¨re logique de la dÃ©signation Il existe un lien pertinent entre le nom proposÃ© et le lieu Ã  nommer dans le respect des thÃ©matiques existantes, sâ€™il y a lieu. Dans les cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronÃ§ons devront porter le nom des tronÃ§ons existants. ï‚· DÃ©signation commÃ©morative Le nom proposÃ© est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment dâ€™appartenance Ã  la ville. Il met en valeur lâ€™identitÃ© boisbriannaise, les lieux dâ€™appartenance, la diversitÃ© culturelle de la population ainsi que le caractÃ¨re francophone de la ville. ï‚· Doublon et homonyme Le nom proposÃ© nâ€™est ni un doublon ni un homonyme dâ€™un lieu existant; aucune redondance ni aucun risque de confusion ne seront ainsi engendrÃ©s par celuici. 

UnicitÃ© du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou toute entitÃ© gÃ©ographique se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel. De la mÃªme faÃ§on, la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec officialise un seul nom pour une voie de communication ou pour chacun des tronÃ§ons de celle-ci afin dâ€™Ã©viter quâ€™une voie sans interruption soit composÃ©e de plusieurs tronÃ§ons ayant chacun leur propre nom. Usage Les toponymes dont lâ€™usage est dÃ©jÃ  Ã©tabli doivent avoir prioritÃ© sâ€™ils satisfont Ã  tous les critÃ¨res. Dans les cas dâ€™usages parallÃ¨les et Ã©galement rÃ©pandus, on accorde la prÃ©fÃ©rence aux noms qui rÃ©pondent le mieux aux autres critÃ¨res. Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique Lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique est en franÃ§ais. Exemple : chemin des Ã‰rables Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique Les noms communs qui entrent dans la composition de nouveaux toponymes sont en franÃ§ais. Exemple : chemin des Ã‰rables Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue dâ€™origine les mots dâ€™une autre langue que le franÃ§ais quâ€™un usage local a consacrÃ©s, en particulier si leur utilisation prÃ©sente un intÃ©rÃªt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Exemple : chemin Maple Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visÃ©s par cette rÃ¨gle et sont Ã©crits dans leur forme originale. Exemple : chemin Queen-Mary PrÃ©sence et unicitÃ© du gÃ©nÃ©rique Le nom dâ€™une voie de communication, dâ€™un parc public, dâ€™un Ã©difice ou dâ€™une autre construction comporte toujours un gÃ©nÃ©rique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus dâ€™un terme exerÃ§ant la fonction de gÃ©nÃ©rique. Utilisation de gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent prÃ©senter des gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes aux avis terminologiques. Ces gÃ©nÃ©riques sont rÃ©pertoriÃ©s sur le site web de la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec dans la section Normes et procÃ©dures â€“ Terminologie gÃ©ographique. Utilisation dâ€™un nom dÃ©jÃ  officiel Lorsquâ€™on utilise un toponyme officiel ou lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique dâ€™un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte la forme, moyennant lâ€™ajout de majuscules et de traits dâ€™union en fonction des rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture toponymiques. Par exemple, le nom officiel Lac du Clocher est repris de faÃ§on intÃ©grale dans le nom chemin du Lac-du-Clocher ",Application form added to OneDrive folder,mfgagne@ville.boisbriand.qc.ca,45.612222,-73.839167

- Promouvoir le patrimoine de la Ville; - Avoir des noms qui sont propres Ã  la Ville; - Conserver la mÃ©moire des noms et des lieux; - Faire revivre la mÃ©moire de nos pionniers; - Faire preuve dâ€™originalitÃ©. 

Les propositions soumises au conseil lors des procÃ©dures prÃ©vues aux articles 4 ou 5 doivent provenir de la liste. Une proposition peut ne pas provenir de la liste pourvu quâ€™elle respecte la prÃ©sente politique et plus particuliÃ¨rement les objectifs identifiÃ©s Ã  lâ€™article 2. Cette proposition doit Ãªtre expliquÃ©e et une justification doit Ãªtre donnÃ©e sur la raison pour laquelle aucune proposition de la liste nâ€™a Ã©tÃ© retenue. 3 Cette liste aura Ã©tÃ© prÃ©alablement soumise au comitÃ© pour recommandation au conseil. Cette liste est revue Ã  une frÃ©quence suffisante pour assurer une diversitÃ© de propositions. 

Suite Ã  la signature dâ€™un protocole dâ€™entente relatif Ã  des travaux municipaux comprenant une nouvelle rue ou Ã  lâ€™acceptation dâ€™un plan image comprenant une allÃ©e dâ€™accÃ¨s ou suite Ã  lâ€™amÃ©nagement dâ€™un nouveau lieu qui requiÃ¨re dâ€™Ãªtre nommÃ©, le conseil nomme cette rue, cette allÃ©e dâ€™accÃ¨s ou ce lieu. Le propriÃ©taire de cette rue, de cette allÃ©e dâ€™accÃ¨s ou de ce lieu est consultÃ© pour trouver un nom Ã  lâ€™entitÃ© Ã  nommer. Sâ€™il ne soumet aucune proposition au fonctionnaire dans un dÃ©lai de 30 jours de la signature du protocole dâ€™entente, de lâ€™acceptation du plan image dans le cas dâ€™une allÃ©e dâ€™accÃ¨s ou de lâ€™amÃ©nagement du nouveau lieu, le conseil procÃ¨de au choix du nom, sans plus amples dÃ©lais. 

Lorsque la rue, lâ€™allÃ©e dâ€™accÃ¨s ou le lieu est dÃ©jÃ  existant, le conseil conserve le nom dÃ©jÃ  existant ou le modifie aprÃ¨s avoir consultÃ© le requÃ©rant de cette nouvelle dÃ©nomination et son propriÃ©taire. La procÃ©dure est enclenchÃ©e par la soumission dâ€™une proposition de modification de nom par un requÃ©rant. Cette proposition est transmise au propriÃ©taire de cette entitÃ© qui a 30 jours pour lâ€™accepter, soumettre une nouvelle proposition ou demander de conserver le nom dÃ©jÃ  existant. Ã€ lâ€™Ã©chÃ©ance de ce dÃ©lai, le conseil dÃ©cide de conserver le nom existant ou procÃ¨de au choix dâ€™un nouveau nom, sans plus amples dÃ©lais. 

Les propositions doivent Ãªtre faites par Ã©crit et doivent Ãªtre soumises au fonctionnaire. Dans le cas oÃ¹ le nom dâ€™une personne est considÃ©rÃ©, le fonctionnaire contacte un reprÃ©sentant de cette famille, lorsquâ€™il y en a un qui demeure dans la ville et quâ€™il est possible de le faire afin de recevoir lâ€™aval de cette derniÃ¨re. La famille pourra prendre 15 jours pour signifier sa position, par Ã©crit. Ã€ la rÃ©ception de la position de la famille ou Ã  lâ€™Ã©chÃ©ance du dÃ©lai de 15 jours, sâ€™il y a lieu, le conseil nomme lâ€™entitÃ© Ã  nommer. 

Les critÃ¨res de dÃ©cision pour nommer une rue, une allÃ©e ou un lieu sont : - le respect de la prÃ©sente politique; - lorsque le nom dâ€™une personne est considÃ©rÃ© pour nommer une rue, une allÃ©e ou un lieu et quâ€™il est appropriÃ© de le faire, le prÃ©nom doit Ãªtre ajoutÃ©; - ne pas se restreindre Ã  lâ€™emplacement physique de la rue, de lâ€™allÃ©e ou du lieu pour promouvoir le patrimoine dâ€™un secteur donnÃ©; - autant que possible, la proposition soumise ne doit pas Ãªtre longue. 

Le nom choisi doit Ãªtre conforme aux critÃ¨res de choix et aux rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture Ã©tablis par la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec qui approuve et officialise les toponymes et les odonymes. 

Exceptionnellement, une proposition qui ne respecte pas les dispositions de la prÃ©sente politique pourra Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©e. Cette proposition pourra Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©e dans les circonstances suivantes : - lorsquâ€™il y a un thÃ¨me dÃ©jÃ  en force dans un secteur donnÃ© (exemple : parc destinÃ© principalement aux enfants, secteur comportant des noms de peintre, etc.). Par contre, sâ€™il est possible, il faut Ã©galement considÃ©rer la prÃ©sente politique (exemple : choisir un peintre ayant un lien avec la ville pour le secteur comportant des noms de peintre); - lorsque le nom est temporaire. Par exemple, lorsque la rue est vouÃ©e Ã  Ãªtre prolongÃ©e Ã  moyen terme pour rejoindre une autre rue dÃ©jÃ  nommÃ©e. - lorsque, de lâ€™avis du conseil, une circonstance particuliÃ¨re fait en sorte que la prÃ©sente politique ne peut Ãªtre respectÃ©e intÃ©gralement. La proposition doit Ãªtre expliquÃ©e et une justification doit Ãªtre donnÃ©e sur la raison pour laquelle la politique ne peut Ãªtre respectÃ©e.

Le dÃ©pÃ´t dâ€™une requÃªte est suivi par lâ€™envoi dâ€™un accusÃ© de rÃ©ception indiquant au requÃ©rant que sa demande sera traitÃ©e dans les meilleurs dÃ©lais lors de la prochaine rencontre du comitÃ© patrimoine et toponymie. Toute proposition de dÃ©nomination reÃ§ue par la Ville est ensuite acheminÃ©e au comitÃ©. Lorsquâ€™il sâ€™agit du nom dâ€™une personne, le comitÃ© sâ€™informe auprÃ¨s de la famille ou des proches pour obtenir plus de dÃ©tails tout en mentionnant Ã  ces derniers quâ€™une analyse sera faite. Ã€ la suite de lâ€™analyse de la proposition, le comitÃ© patrimoine et toponymie peut rejeter une appellation proposÃ©e, selon les critÃ¨res Ã©tablis. Une lettre expliquant les motifs du refus sera alors acheminÃ©e au requÃ©rant et le dossier sera fermÃ©. Le conseil municipal sera informÃ© par le biais des comptes rendus des travaux du comitÃ©. Dans le cas oÃ¹ une proposition est retenue par le comitÃ© patrimoine et toponymie, la Ville verra Ã  obtenir un avis technique de la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. Une fois lâ€™avis technique obtenu, le comitÃ© transmet sa recommandation au conseil municipal. Dans le cas dâ€™une dÃ©cision favorable par le conseil municipal, le comitÃ© informera la famille de la personne honorÃ©e, le cas Ã©chÃ©ant, et le requÃ©rant. Le toponyme sera alors soit versÃ© dans la banque de noms disponibles ou adoptÃ© par rÃ©solution par le conseil municipal pour dÃ©signer un lieu. Une fois la rÃ©solution adoptÃ©e, celle-ci est transmise Ã  la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec, qui officialise la nomination. Celle-ci entre en vigueur lors de la rÃ©ception dâ€™une rÃ©ponse dâ€™officialisation de la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. La Ville achemine alors lâ€™information aux services concernÃ©s (urbanisme, Ã©valuation, travaux publics, communications, sÃ©curitÃ© civile, Postes Canada, etc.). Dans le cas oÃ¹ un toponyme nâ€™est pas approuvÃ© par le conseil municipal, celui-ci devra retourner le dossier au comitÃ© patrimoine et toponymie en mentionnant les raisons pour lesquelles ce nom nâ€™a pas Ã©tÃ© retenu. Le toponyme pourra alors, selon le cas, Ãªtre conservÃ© dans la banque de noms, avec une mention du refus. 

5. RÃˆGLES DE DÃ‰NOMINATION 5.1. Principes directeurs Voici les principes et critÃ¨res qui sont pris en compte dans lâ€™analyse des propositions dÃ©posÃ©es : â€¢ Souligner le caractÃ¨re unique du territoire de Rouyn-Noranda et de son histoire. â€¢ Afin de favoriser un Ã©quilibre, prioriser des noms qui correspondent Ã  une toponymie fÃ©minine, autochtone et de la diversitÃ© culturelle. Dans le cas de la toponymie autochtone, une attention particuliÃ¨re doit Ãªtre accordÃ©e pour Ãªtre Ã©tudiÃ©e de concert avec les communautÃ©s concernÃ©es. 8 â€¢ Tenir compte de la nature du lieu, de son utilisation et de lâ€™histoire du secteur gÃ©ographique (le bon nom au bon endroit); â€¢ Lorsquâ€™il sâ€™agit du nom dâ€™une personne, tenir compte de son lien avec le lieu choisi. â€¢ Favoriser les noms complets des personnes (prÃ©nom et nom); â€¢ Lorsquâ€™il sâ€™agit dâ€™un nom commun, tenir compte des Ã©lÃ©ments gÃ©ographiques et topographiques Ã  proximitÃ© du lieu ou privilÃ©gier les noms pouvant servir Ã  repÃ©rer plus facilement lâ€™endroit. â€¢ Pour les parcs, favoriser un nom reflÃ©tant les caractÃ©ristiques du milieu naturel environnant, le nom de la rue adjacente (ou du quartier) pour un meilleur repÃ©rage ou le nom dâ€™une personne en lien avec le secteur. â€¢ Pour les Ã©difices publics, favoriser le nom dâ€™une personnalitÃ© publique qui a apportÃ© une contribution exceptionnelle au dÃ©veloppement local, rÃ©gional ou national. â€¢ Lorsquâ€™un nouveau dÃ©veloppement rÃ©sidentiel se prÃ©sente, privilÃ©gier un thÃ¨me commun pour la dÃ©signation des nouvelles rues, sans toutefois lâ€™exiger. â€¢ Ã‰viter l'emploi de noms Ã  connotation pÃ©jorative ou grossiÃ¨re, de mÃªme que les choix susceptibles de provoquer ou d'alimenter une dissension ou controverse. â€¢ Ne pas retenir comme toponyme le nom dâ€™une personne vivante ou dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©e depuis moins dâ€™un an. â€¢ Ã‰viter les noms Ã  consonance semblable (homonyme) ou doublons qui pourraient confondre le repÃ©rage par les services dâ€™urgence. â€¢ Respecter les rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©critures Ã©tablies par la Commission de toponymie du QuÃ©bec. â€¢ Ne pas faire disparaÃ®tre un toponyme en le remplaÃ§ant par un autre. Par contre, advenant quâ€™un toponyme soit jugÃ© largement controversÃ©, un changement pourrait alors Ãªtre envisagÃ©. 
 

5.2. Types de dÃ©signations Il existe diffÃ©rents types de dÃ©signations : â€¢ Honorifique : Pour Ã©voquer la mÃ©moire de personnes qui se sont distinguÃ©es au sein de la communautÃ© de Rouyn-Noranda dans les domaines artistique, communautaire, Ã©conomique, Ã©ducatif, religieux, scientifique, social, sportif, etc. â€¢ Historique : Pour Ã©voquer la mÃ©moire de personnages de lâ€™histoire locale comme des pionniers et pionniÃ¨res, des vieilles et grandes familles dâ€™un quartier, un Ã©vÃ¨nement marquant, etc. 9 â€¢ GÃ©ographique : Pour Ã©voquer des traits gÃ©ographiques ou faisant appel aux traits caractÃ©ristiques dâ€™un lieu. â€¢ ThÃ©matique : Celle-ci est utilisÃ©e lorsque plusieurs emplacements Ã  nommer sont regroupÃ©s dans un mÃªme dÃ©veloppement urbain ou rural. Dans ce cas, il est possible dâ€™Ã©voquer des noms de personnalitÃ© et des noms communs en lien avec la thÃ©matique retenue.

Le premier r´le de la toponymie est de permettre le repérage rapide dâ€™un lieu. Lâ€™attribution dâ€™un nom sert   distinguer ce lieu des autres. Ce processus doit respecter des r¨gles bien établies. 
 
La toponymie exprime par des noms des aspects de notre culture et fait partie du patrimoine collectif. Ces noms traduisent une reconnaissance publique dâ€™une cause, de la mémoire dâ€™un personnage ou dâ€™un événement.  

On choisit donc un nom de rue ou de parc pour rendre hommage et se souvenir. Le toponyme est aussi porteur dâ€™émotion : il anime le lieu et contribue au sentiment dâ€™appartenance   la collectivité. 

Le patrimoine toponymique, une richesse   sauvegarder

Quebec_Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville,,,Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville,Quebec,Yes,"1.1 Contexte Au QuÃ©bec, la Commission de toponymie a le mandat dâ€™effectuer lâ€™inventaire, la normalisation, lâ€™officialisation et la diffusion des noms de lieux. Les municipalitÃ©s sont cependant responsables du choix de leurs noms de voies de communication, ou odonymes, ainsi que de celui des noms de parcs publics, dâ€™Ã©difices et dâ€™autres constructions qui leur appartiennent. La Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville accueillera au cours des prochaines annÃ©es, des projets nÃ©cessitant lâ€™amÃ©nagement de nouvelles rues. La prÃ©sente politique de dÃ©nomination toponymique est un outil pour orienter les choix de toponymes pour le conseil local de patrimoine et de toponymie et le conseil municipal. Elle Ã©dicte des lignes directrices en matiÃ¨re de toponymie garantissant, par le fait mÃªme, une qualitÃ© odonymique sur son territoire. La politique permet Ã  la Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville de gÃ©rer efficacement lâ€™ensemble des dossiers toponymiques et dâ€™amÃ©liorer la mÃ©thodologie en matiÃ¨re de dÃ©nomination. 1.2 Objectifs La politique de dÃ©nomination toponymique vise Ã  : - Mettre en valeur les particularitÃ©s et les spÃ©cificitÃ©s locales propres Ã  chaque secteur du territoire de la Ville; - Mettre en valeur lâ€™histoire et le patrimoine de la Ville par la dÃ©nomination de ses rues, ses chemins, ses lieux et ses bÃ¢timents; - DÃ©velopper un sentiment dâ€™appartenance des citoyens par la dÃ©nomination; - Ã‰tablir une dÃ©marche claire et respectueuse pour procÃ©der Ã  la dÃ©nomination toponymique des lieux. 1.3 Champs dâ€™application La prÃ©sente politique sâ€™applique Ã  toutes requÃªtes de dÃ©nomination toponymique, peu importe la nature et la provenance. Elle inclut celles initiÃ©es par les diverses instances de la Ville. Le conseil local du patrimoine et de toponymie doit exercer sa mission sur le territoire de la Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. Les lieux et les espaces Ã  dÃ©signer sont : - Les voies de communication (rues, chemins, etc.); - Les parcs et espaces verts publics; - Les Ã©difices et salles publiques Ã  lâ€™intÃ©rieur des Ã©difices; - Les Ã©quipements sportifs ou culturels publics; - Tous les autres lieux ou espaces dâ€™intÃ©rÃªt public. 

4. PROCÃ‰DURES 4.1 DÃ©pÃ´t dâ€™une demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique Tout citoyen, groupe de personnes ou organisme qui dÃ©pose une demande de dÃ©nomination toponymique doit remplir le formulaire prÃ©vu Ã  cet effet et le dÃ©poser Ã  la Direction de lâ€™urbanisme, de lâ€™environnement et du dÃ©veloppement durable. Le requÃ©rant a la responsabilitÃ© de fournir toutes les informations relatives au toponyme proposÃ© nÃ©cessaires Ã  lâ€™analyse de sa demande, expliquer lâ€™essence du toponyme proposÃ© et les raisons pour lesquelles il devrait Ãªtre officialisÃ©. 

5. RÃˆGLES DE DÃ‰NOMINATION 5.1 CritÃ¨res dâ€™analyse dictÃ©s par la Ville - Relation entre le nom et le lieu quâ€™il dÃ©signe - Favoriser les noms ayant un lien logique, Ã©troit et dâ€™intÃ©rÃªt avec le lieu; - Tenir compte de la nature et de lâ€™usage du lieu (voie, parc, place publique, immeuble, contexte rÃ©sidentiel, commercial, industriel ou culturel, etc.); - Tenir compte des caractÃ©ristiques gÃ©ographiques naturelles du lieu (faune, flore, gÃ©ologie, etc.); - Tenir compte de lâ€™histoire du quartier en termes urbain (usages actuels ou passÃ©s) et social (pionniers, longÃ©vitÃ© familiale sur les lieux, anecdotes); - Tenir compte des traditions du milieu local ou rÃ©gional (surnom du lieu). - OriginalitÃ©, valeur poÃ©tique et euphonie (harmonie des sons) - Favoriser les noms inspirant des images fortes; - PrÃ©server les rÃ©gionalismes; - Ã‰viter les toponymes banals et utilisÃ©s frÃ©quemment; - Ã‰viter les toponymes servant de dÃ©signation publicitaire; - Ã‰viter les noms dont lâ€™attribution pourrait provoquer la controverse. - Sentiment dâ€™appartenance - Favoriser les noms mettant en valeur lâ€™identitÃ© montarvilloise, les lieux dâ€™appartenance et le caractÃ¨re du milieu dans lequel il sâ€™inscrit. - Mise en valeur du patrimoine culturel - Favoriser les noms issus de lâ€™histoire et du patrimoine local, rÃ©gional ou national (rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  une personne, un fait ou un Ã©vÃ©nement); - Honorer une seule fois une mÃªme personne ou chose. - Point de repÃ¨re - Tenir compte de la toponymie existante; - Favoriser les noms permettant de se repÃ©rer plus facilement; - Ã‰viter les homonymes et les doublons. - Lorsquâ€™il sâ€™agit du nom dâ€™une personne : - Favoriser le nom de personnes ayant contribuÃ© de faÃ§on significative au dÃ©veloppement, au dynamisme ou au bien-Ãªtre de la communautÃ©; - PrivilÃ©gier le nom sous lequel la personne est la mieux connue (nom complet, titre accompagnÃ© du nom complet, pseudonyme, etc.); - Retenir le nom complet de la personne (prÃ©nom et nom de famille); - Recourir au nom de famille seul pour honorer une famille complÃ¨te. 

5.2 CritÃ¨res de choix prescrits par la Commission Le nom doit respecter les rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture et Ãªtre conforme aux critÃ¨res de choix de la Commission. - UnicitÃ© du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou entitÃ© gÃ©ographique se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel. - Usage Les toponymes dont lâ€™usage est le mieux Ã©tabli doivent avoir prioritÃ© sâ€™ils ne dÃ©rogent pas Ã  dâ€™autres critÃ¨res. Dans les cas dâ€™usages parallÃ¨les et Ã©galement rÃ©pandus, on accorde la prÃ©fÃ©rence aux noms qui rÃ©pondent le mieux aux autres critÃ¨res. - Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique Lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©rique est en franÃ§ais. Exemple : Chemin De La RabastaliÃ¨re Ouest - Langue de lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique Les noms communs composant de nouveaux toponymes sont en franÃ§ais. Exemple : Chemin De La RabastaliÃ¨re Ouest Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue dâ€™origine les mots dâ€™une autre langue que le franÃ§ais quâ€™un usage local a consacrÃ©s, en particulier si leur utilisation prÃ©sente un intÃ©rÃªt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Exemple : Chemin Maple Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visÃ©s par cette rÃ¨gle et sont Ã©crits dans leur forme originale. Exemple : Place Stephen-Leacock - PrÃ©sence et unicitÃ© du gÃ©nÃ©rique Le nom dâ€™une voie de communication, dâ€™un parc public, dâ€™un Ã©difice ou dâ€™une autre construction comporte toujours un gÃ©nÃ©rique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus dâ€™un terme exerÃ§ant la fonction de gÃ©nÃ©rique. - Utilisation de gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent prÃ©senter des gÃ©nÃ©riques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de lâ€™Office quÃ©bÃ©cois de la langue franÃ§aise). - Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©es depuis moins dâ€™un an Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom dâ€™une personne vivante ou dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©e depuis moins dâ€™un an. - Utilisation dâ€™un nom dÃ©jÃ  officiel Lorsquâ€™un toponyme officiel ou lâ€™Ã©lÃ©ment spÃ©cifique dâ€™un toponyme officiel est utilisÃ© pour composer un autre toponyme, il doit en respecter la forme, moyennant lâ€™ajout de majuscules et de traits dâ€™union en fonction des rÃ¨gles dâ€™Ã©criture toponymiques. Exemple : Le nom officiel Â« Lac Seigneurial Â» est repris de faÃ§on intÃ©grale dans le nom Â« Chemin du Lac-Seigneurial Â». 5.3 ParticularitÃ©s Lorsquâ€™une rue est prolongÃ©e, câ€™est-Ã -dire quâ€™elle nâ€™est pas sectionnÃ©e par une intersection, il est prÃ©fÃ©rable de garder le mÃªme odonyme. Si le prolongement rejoint une autre rue existante avec un nom diffÃ©rent, lâ€™odonyme choisi doit Ãªtre le mÃªme que lâ€™une des rues quâ€™il rejoint.

In the absence of a submission for consideration of a name for a municipal park or facility, Recreation and Culture Division Staff will provide the Coordinator of Parks and Recreation Services the names as recommended by Municipal Staff for the specific park or facility. â€¢ Where proposed names are site specific, staff shall undertake to weigh the significance of the proposed name against the policy guidelines for municipal park or facility naming, as well as against those considered in the parks name listing inventory as maintained and updated by the Recreation and Culture Division. â€¢ Processing the application involves confirmation of criteria, discussion with the applicable town departments/external stakeholders, including emergency services, and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee in consultation with the Coordinator of Parks and Recreation Services. â€¢ Each application/nomination will be reviewed and evaluated initially by Cobourg Recreation and Culture Division Staff, and each application/nomination that meets the policy requirements will be submitted to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee for review. â€¢ The Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee shall review all applications and nominations for municipal park or facility names as forwarded by the Recreation and Culture Division.
