The naming of public streets, trails and civic facilities shall also provide the opportunity to recognize, reflect and commemorate people, events, places, wildlife, flora, fauna and natural features that are associated with the City of Moncton, New Brunswick or Canada.<br>3. It is important to the City of Moncton to support and celebrate the two official languages and linguistic communities, promote a value and source of pride that they represent through their unique cultures, and foster a sense of belonging and true equality for all of its citizens. Names selected for its public streets, trails and civic facilities shall reflect and celebrate the historical, cultural, ethnic and linguistic characteristics of the community and citizens shall have an opportunity to contribute to the naming process.<br>4.

The City will continue to rely upon the name bank to serve as a primary source of potential names for public streets, trails and civic facilities. Alternate names, not found in the Name Bank, may be considered by City Council in special circumstances, as detailed in the Naming Policy.<br>6. A Staff Name Bank Technical Group will be responsible for updating and maintaining the Moncton Name Bank and ensuring compliance with the Naming Policy.<br>7. All proposed names to be added or retired from the Moncton Name Bank and the proposed names of all public streets, trails and civic facilities shall be forwarded to Moncton City Council for approval.<br>8. The process and requirements for naming streets, trails and civic facilities will be clearly outlined and made available for the public and development community to access on the City’s website.<br>4. General Naming Criteria<br>1. To ensure that emergency services and individuals can locate addresses and facilities easily and without confusion:<br>a. All proposed names shall be unique. There shall be no duplication of names within the City of Moncton or with names already existing in adjoining communities that share emergency service providers (Fire and RCMP). In addition:<br>i.

Identical names with different suffixes shall be refused (e.g. Caddy Crescent and Caddy Court);<br>iii. Identical names with different extensions shall be avoided (e.g. Meadowvale and Meadowlands);<br>iv.

novascotia_annapoliscounty,,record,Annapolis County,Nova Scotia,Yes,"Street Naming: <br><br>Naming of roads, streets and communities and the adjustment of community boundaries is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions and established practices of the Department of Transportation & Public Works and the Municipality. Procedures must be consistent to ensure that the integrity of the civic addressing system is maintained. This policy defines the steps that shall be followed when it is proposed that:  the name of an existing road or street (public or private) be changed or the name or boundaries of a community be changed; or  the Municipality assign the name of a new road, street or road reserve as a result of subdivision of land pursuant to the Subdivision Bylaw; or  the Municipality assign the name of a new private road or street or road reserve as a result of subdivision of land pursuant to the Subdivision Bylaw; or  a name be assigned to an existing road or community not previously named. New names for roads, streets and communities will be carefully reviewed to minimize the potential for conflicts with existing names. Changing the name of a road, street or community has important historical and public safety implications with preference or greater consideration to be given to the traditional name acknowledged by local residents. Accordingly, a name change should only be considered in a very limited number of situations. Emergency responder services shall be consulted as a part of any civic address change process. <br><br>BASIC POLICY PRINCIPLES 4.1 Procedures and evaluation criteria. Unless otherwise stated, the procedures and evaluation criteria are to be in accordance with the guidelines specified in the Nova Scotia Civic Address File (NSCAF) Pilot Project - Final Report. 4.2 Duplication, numbers, suffixes or prefixes are to be avoided. There should be no duplication or near duplication of road and community names within the Municipality. Numerals should not appear in a road or community name nor names differentiated by just a prefix or suffix. Examples - If Bayview Boulevard exists in the County, this name (with or without add-ons) would not be accepted for another community in the County. - Since the community of Port Lorne exists, this name (with or without changes in prefixes or suffixes) would not be accepted for another community in the County (such as Fort Lorne, Upper Port Lorne, Port Lorne Extension). - 1 st Avenue or 2nd Street would not be acceptable. - First Avenue or Second Street would be acceptable. - Upper Station Road or Lower Water Street would not be acceptable. - If Portland Road exists, the name Portland Street would not be acceptable. <br><br>4.3 Confusion is to be avoided. In order to minimize diction problems when reporting road names under stress, names that sound very similar are to be avoided. Examples - If Smith Road exists; then Smyth Road, Smith’s Road or Smit Road would not be accepted. - Since the community of Lawrencetown exists, then Lorncetown, Laurencetown, Lewiston or Lawrenceville would not be accepted. 4.4 Continuity of road name to be a criteria. A road running in one compass direction should have one name only and should, at least within a community, have the same name throughout its entire length. 4.5 Changing an existing name is to be discouraged. A request to change the name of a road, street or community will be considered only if: 4.5.1 there are valid public safety considerations which affect the civic address system and/or the E911 database; or 4.5.2 valid issues have been sufficiently documented and adequately presented relative to community identity, heritage and traditions; and 4.5.3 property owners have been adequately informed and a 2/3 majority or greater of area residents support the change of road name as evidenced by a community survey in an approved format; or 4.5.4 there are important civic objectives or purposes which may be achieved by approving a change; and 4.5.5 the change is approved by Municipal Council. <br><br>EVALUATION CRITERIA <br><br>5.1 General Criteria 5.1.1 Names that existed prior to approval of this policy are hereby accepted unless the Civic Addressing Coordinator determines a change in name is necessary. 5.1.2 Only English or French versions will be accepted, with appropriate accents being applied in accordance to the rules of the language and the English version being easy to pronounce, recognizable and easy to spell. 5.1.3 The long-standing, local usage of the name by the local public will be given preference. 5.1.4 Names must reflect good taste as perceived by the general public. 5.1.5 Names submitted with special characters will only be accepted if found in the ASCH special character set (See Schedule A) 5.1.6 Qualifying words (upper, lower, new, old, north, south, east, west, etc.) will not be accepted for proposed changes or new names unless such qualifier is found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer or if approved by the Civic Addressing Coordinator. 5.1.7 All names for roads or streets must have an associated road type, and only road types identified in Section 5.3 will be accepted. 5.1.8 Road names containing a number must be alphanumeric (such as First Street) and submissions using a numeric (such as 1st Street) will not be accepted. 5.1.9 Name submissions for communities and roads (including road type) shall have a total of no more than 35 characters. 5.1.10 The following identifiers or references are not acceptable: (1) homonyms or like sounding names within the Municipality; for example, “Smith”, Smyth”, Smythe”, “Smith’s”, “Smiths”, “Smit” or “Smits”. <br><br>(2) a personal name (combination of given and surname) unless such application is in the public interest. (The person commemorated should have contributed significantly to the area where the road is located and the adoption of the personal name during the lifetime of the person concerned should only be made in exceptional circumstances.) (3) formal titles of distinctions associated with a person name such as Captain, Major or Doctor. (4) company or commercial product names and names associated with copyright or trademarks. 5.1.11 Ownership of land should not in itself be grounds for the application of the owner’s name to a road or community, nor does ownership confer the right to specify the name without consultation with area residents. 5.1.12 Mixed language name submissions should be avoided (example: Chapeau Road or Port Petite community). <br><br>Road Types Only the following road types will be accepted for name submissions:  <br><br>Type – Code - Definition  <br><br>Avenue (also Fr.) - Ave - A thoroughfare in an urban setting that is used primarily for local traffic.  <br><br>Boulevard (also Fr.) - Blvd  - A major thoroughfare running in a diagonal direction and usually with a landscaped center.  <br><br>Court (also Fr.) - Crt  - A short drive usually less than 300 metres, branching  <br><br>Crescent – Cres - from an intersection and ending in a cul-de-sac or dead (Croissant-Fr.

novascotia_stewiacke,,record,Stewiacke,Nova Scotia,Yes,"1. All new private road and municipal street names shall conform with the following principles: a) Avoid duplication - there should be no duplication of road names and numbers used as names should be avoided. It is also preferable not to differentiate road and street names exclusively by selecting a different road type, for example, Portland Road and Portland Drive. b) Avoid confusion - road names that sound very similar should be avoided. The reason for avoiding similar or similar sounding names is to eliminate diction problems when people are reporting road names under stress. c) Establish continuity - a road running in one compass direction should have one name only and should have the same name throughout its entire length in the Town and, if possible, in adjoining municipalities. 2. In particular, the following standards shall be applied: a) Road names should be: i. easy to pronounce; ii. comprised of recognizable words or acceptable combination of words; iii. easy to spell for a person with intermediate reading level; iv. take into account any long-standing local usage of name or words used in the name; v. in good taste; vi. contain only those special characters which can be electronically recorded and manipulated with ease using varying conventional software, and shall exclude stylized symbols found in the Latin 1 ASCII set, for example, #, %, etc. b) Qualifying words such as Upper, Lower, New, Old, etc., should be avoided unless the qualifying word has been applied in some other official context (for example as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer); c) All names must have an associated road type and the road type should conform with the road type criteria in the attached Road Type Schedule, but existing nonconforming road types may be continued to avoid the cost, confusion and disturbance of changing only a road type; d) Road names should be alpha-numeric and name submissions using a numeric should be rejected: for example, ""First Street"" would be acceptable, but ""1st"" Street"" should not be accepted. e) Where a new road is a continuation of an existing road, wherever possible the new road will be given the same name as the existing road. f) There will be no duplication of road names within the Town and, if possible, duplication of names with names used in immediately adjoining municipal units should be avoided. g) Road names, including abbreviated road type, shall have no more than 35 characters. h) If the road is named after a topographic feature or place name, the name should reflect the official name as found in the Nova Scotia Gazetteer. i) A personal name (a combination of given name and surname) should not be applied to a municipal street unless such application is in the public interest. The person commemorated should have contributed significantly in the area in which the road is located. The adoption of a personal name during the lifetime of the person concerned should only be made in exceptional circumstances. Formal titles of distinction, such as Captain, Major, Admiral, etc., should be avoided. Company or commercial product names and names associated with copyright or trademarks should be avoided.

newfoundlandandlabrador_stjohns,,record,St. John's,Newfoundland and Labrador,Yes,"Street Naming: <br><br>This new policy provides formalized guidance for existing practices, while allowing the incorporation of best practices from other jurisdictions. The new Street Naming Advisory Committee (replacing the Nomenclature Committee) will review street naming applications received from both developers and the general public. The Committee will also solicit feedback from the Inclusion Advisory Committee, and other groups as required, in order to support a more equitable and diverse selection of names. The policy also addresses the issue of street renaming requests. Such requests will only be considered if there is an engineering rationale or the continued use of the name would not be in the best interest of the City. Requestors must be City residents or property owners and will need to provide a petition with support from a majority of property owners on the Street before the request will be processed for further consideration. <br><br>Key Considerations/Implications: 1. Budget/Financial Implications: There are no expected immediate financial implications and the policy will not result in any immediate cost increases. The policy does note that City will not reimburse any costs that may be incurred by any property owner due to reassignment. The naming and renaming of streets have associated costs for the City (signage, staff time, contractor time), which are not currently allocated in any budget. When seeking approval of a specific new street name or a street to be renamed, Council will be provided with an estimated cost for implementation. 2. Partners or Other Stakeholders:  Inclusion Advisory Committee (IAC)  St. John’s Regional Fire Department  Other emergency services (police, ambulance)  St. John’s Transportation Commission  Electrical utilities and telecommunications providers 3. Alignment with Strategic Directions/Adopted Plans: “An Effective City” Goal: “Work with our employees to improve organizational performance through effective processes and policies”. 4. Alignment with Adopted Plans: This policy will interact with the Development Regulations, as developers will be required to follow the new process for street naming. 5. Accessibility and Inclusion: The IAC will be consulted prior to adding names to the Reserved Street Names Inventory. 6. Legal or Policy Implications: The Office of the City Solicitor has reviewed and approved the policy. 7. Privacy Implications: Implementation of the policy will require compliance with the City’s Privacy Management Policy and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015. The City’s Access and Privacy Analyst was consulted during the development of the policy, procedures and related forms. 8. Engagement and Communications Considerations: Discussions with the Marketing and Communications Division have begun regarding communications of the new policy. Once the policy is operational, there will be ongoing engagement requirements for any street renaming and the Committee will discuss how to proceed with the Organizational Performance and Strategy Division. 9. Human Resource Implications: The policy will be implemented with existing human resources. However, should the City receive an influx of multiple requests for street renaming over a short period of time, additional resources may be required. 10.Procurement Implications: For streets that are named or renamed, there will be a need for contracted services to install signage, using approved procurement policies and procedures. 11.Information Technology Implications: Not applicable. 12.Other Implications: Not applicable. <br><br>No other place name policies",N/A,cityclerk@stjohns.ca,47.482197,-52.797069

Municipal Naming also serves as a means to celebrate our culture, role in the national park, and the unique identity of this mountain community, its heritage, geography, flora, fauna or natural features associated with the town. Town Council can commemorate important events or honour the outstanding achievements or significant community contributions of groups, organizations or individuals. Municipal Naming is applied in situations where the Town does not receive from external parties a financial contribution, goods or services, or when a contribution has been donated, but the external party does not seek reciprocal consideration. This policy complements the objectives of the Addressing Bylaw, which applies to naming of streets and roadways. <br><br> <br><br>Addressing Bylaw: <br><br>Authority 3.1 The Town Manager is authorized to make recommendations to Council in respect to: a) assigning names to Public Roadways, Private Roads and Lanes; and b) revising such names 3.2 Council shall confirm or amend by resolution any such recommendations of the Town Manager made pursuant to section 3.1. Process 3.3 In making recommendations to Council, the Town Manager shall be bound by the following: a) Notwithstanding Subsection (c), all roads except minor thoroughfares shall each be assigned one (1) name, and except to identify a different type of thoroughfare, such name shall not be assigned to more than one (1) road; b) Roads may be named after animals or trees native to Banff National Park, national parks, geological features, topographical features, or anything else Council considers appropriate; c) Where it is considered that a Lane is used as the primary access to one (1) or more abutting Properties, such a Lane may be assigned a name. 4.1 The Town Manager is authorized to: a) assign Civic Address Numbers to Parcels of land and Buildings; b) amend, designate or re-designate Civic Address Numbers in consideration of public safety and/or service delivery; c) append a Unit number to a Civic Address Number in order to clearly address Units; d) amend, designate or re-designate Unit numbers in consideration of public safety and/or service delivery. 4.2 No compensation shall be payable to the Owner or occupants of a Property in conjunction with the exercise of the authority delegated in section 4.1. <br><br>New or Amended Addressing 7.1 The Town Manager shall give the Owner of a Property at least thirty (30) days’ notice in writing of any Civic Address Number assigned to such Property, pursuant to this Bylaw; Page 6 of 8 Town of Banff Bylaw 109-2 – Addressing Bylaw 7.2 Notice may be given a) by personal delivery to the Owner, or b) by mail delivery to the address for the Owner shown on the tax roll, or c) by email to the Owner.",N/A,municipal.clerk@banff.ca,51.177778,-115.573611

The Town will consider proposals for street naming but is under no obligation to accept a proposal to name, or rename a street, or assign a ceremonial name to a Street. b. Street names, including ceremonial Street names should portray a strong positive image and have historical, cultural or social significance or contributions to the community, the Town, the Province of Alberta or Canada. c.

Suffixes for Street names are assigned by Infrastructure Services to ensure the appropriate suffix is used to describe the type, function, length and configuration of the Street. f. All Town costs involved in renaming a Street shall be the responsibility of the individual requesting a street name or renaming or ceremonial name. g. Street names, including ceremonial names, shall not: i. Result in, or be perceived to confer, any competitive advantage, benefit or preferential treatment or advertisement to the named party, or a development, product, service or a particular business; ii. Be or be perceived to be discriminatory or derogatory of race, colour, ethnic origin, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual orientation, creed, political affiliation, disability or other social factors; iii.

The proposed name; b. Rationale for naming the Street; c. Documented support from property owners/ residents who directly abut the unnamed street or local community members and/or organizations, and d. A map or an illustration, including major intersections of the unnamed street.

If the proposed name does not comply with this Policy, the Division Head of Infrastructure Services will report to Council; <br><br>RENAMING TOWN STREETS: A proposal to rename a Street is to be made by written request through Infrastructure Services and at minimum is to include: a. Rationale for changing the name and significance of the proposed name; b. Relevance of the proposed name to the Street; c. Documented support, including but not limited to petitions and support letters, from at least 75 percent of property owners that abut the street; and d.

If the proposed name complies with this Policy, the Town will provide public notice on its intention to rename an existing street and the proposed name in compliance with the Town’s Public Participation Policy. If the proposed name does not comply with the Policy, the Division Head of Infrastructure Services will report to Town Council. <br><br>ASSIGNING A CEREMONIAL NAME TO A TOWN STREET: Assigning a ceremonial name to a street is symbolic and should be reserved for honouring individuals, events or organizations that have made a significant positive contribution to their local community, the Town of Coaldale, Alberta or Canada. Assigning a ceremonial name to a street needs to consider the impact of multiple signs on the street, the broader street network, and the public realm, to ensure that signage is not confusing to the public. A proposal to assign a ceremonial name to a Street is to be made by written request and at minimum is to include: i. The Street proposed for the ceremonial name; ii. Rationale and significance of the proposed name; iii. Relevance of the proposed name to the Street, community and Town; iv. Documented support from the local community, including but not limited to petitions and support letters; and v. A map or an illustration, including major intersections of the Street. The proposed name will be considered by Town Council in accordance with the criteria set out in this Policy. If the proposed name complies with this Policy, the Town will provide public notice on its intention to assign a ceremonial name and the proposed name in compliance with the Town’s Public Participation Policy. In circumstances, where a specific Street or location is not identified, Infrastructure Services will provide Street location options in a report to Council. <br><br> <br><br>Statement from senior town planner: <br><br>  <br><br>""We do not have a 'name bank' as such. Historically, western settlements have adopted the simple numeric naming formula (i.e. 1st Street/Ave, 2nd Street/Ave, etc). This naming convention aligns very well with the grid system street network that is the prevailing urban development pattern for prairie communities.  <br><br>  <br><br>Typically the numbering will be centred on a main thoroughfare which was often the railroad. You can see this in many southern Alberta communities which have a 'Railway Avenue', 'Main Street' or 'Centre Street' that is usually located adjacent to the historic rail line. <br><br>  <br><br>With regards to new development, our naming conventions are oftentimes tied to the specific subdivision. For example: the streets within the 'Parkside Acres' subdivision in Coaldale are 'Parkside Green', 'Parkside Drive', and 'Parkside Way'. Streets within the 'Cottonwood Estates' are named after different types of trees (i.e. Aspen Drive, Cedar Crescent, Elm Place, etc.). These names may be proposed by the developer, but must be ultimately approved by the Town Council. <br><br>  <br><br>In terms of place naming, there are a few possible methods: <br><br>- the place is named for a benefactor, donor or sponsor (i.e. Kinship Park for the Kinsmen Club of Coaldale) <br><br>- the place is named by the developer when they plan a subdivision for the area (i.e. Cottonwood Park is within the Cottonwood Estates subdivision)'""",N/A,hailey.winder@coaldale.ca,49.727778,-112.618611

Reason for Policy 1.1 The Town of Cochrane believes in the naming of public areas to honour individuals, families and/or organizations that have made significant contributions to the community. Contributions that have been made in the following areas may be recognized:  Volunteerism  Historical  Celebrity  Honorary 1.2 The Town of Cochrane believes in naming streets to provide a sense of community within developments, and to recognize natural, historical or environmental features, and/or contributing persons and organizations of the Town, in the naming of major roadways. <br><br>1. General Guidelines 1.1 The Parks and Facilities Section will maintain a list of all public areas that may be named in honour of individuals, families or organizations. Public parks/natural areas to be named should be not less than one acre in size. Pathways to be named shall have a natural start and end point and should be not less than one kilometre in length. 1.2 The Planning Services Section will maintain a database of all street names and will work with developers to ensure that no local street or major roadways names are duplicated within the Town of Cochrane. 2. Naming of Streets 2.1 The names of collector or arterial streets which traverse more than one subdivision or community area should reflect natural, historical or environmental features, or contributing persons/organizations of the Town (i.e. Big Hill, Bow River, Quigley, George Fox etc.). 2.2 A list of recommended names for major roadways shall be prepared by Planning Services, with the assistance of the Cochrane and Area Heritage Association or the Cochrane Historical Archival and Preservation Society as required. 2.3 Planning Services shall provide a recommended list of names for major roadways to landowners over which a major roadway will traverse. 2.4 Local streets and major roadway names shall be suggested by developers at the time of subdivision and approved as part of the Subdivision Approval process. In the event that a major roadway is developed outside of the subdivision process, the Senior Leadership Team will determine roadway name. 2.5 Where suitable, the name of local streets shall be prefixed with the name or names associated with the subdivision or community area in which they are located (i.e. Gleneagles Close, Eagleview Way). 2.5 Where suitable, the name of local streets shall be prefixed with the name or names associated with the subdivision or community area in which they are located (i.e. Gleneagles Close, Eagleview Way). 3. Naming of Public Areas 3.1 In naming a public area, the name shall not be duplicated nor shall it approximate phonetically the name of any other public areas, already named within the Town of Cochrane or within the urban fringe area having regard to the possibility of future annexation. 3.2 The name may have some historical significance to Cochrane such that the name shall reflect aboriginal activity and original names in the local area, early pioneers; or pioneering ethnic groups who resetiled and developed the town and surrounding areas; or persons who have contributed to and/or pafticipated in a broad range of public services and / or com mu nity activities. 3,3 The Town of Cochrane shall encourage suggestions for the naming of public areas.

Only submissions that are chosen will be identified publicly. 3,7 The Parks and Facilities Section will prepare and install appropriate signage identifying the names of public areas 3.8 Parkland that is dedicated for the development of schools and school playfields should be named by the school jurisdiction constructing the school. <br><br>Quote from the city:  <br><br>“We informally use Airdrie’s street naming policy for neighbourhoods (which encourages the use of a neighbourhood theme and a variety of suffixes to denote the style of roadway such a cul-de-sac vs a main entrance, vs a crescent,etc) while having a numbered grid system in the traditional downtown.  We do not have a name bank, but when asked we do partner with the Stockman’s Library (which is a local archival library), CHAPS (the Cochrane Historical Archival & Preservation Society) and our organization is slowly making more connections with the indigenous nations that abut our municipality to provide some options.  Situated in the foothills in between Calgary and the Rocky Mountains, we are surrounded by and sit within significant natural landscape features that also offer plenty of name options. For the most part, new neighbourhood names are first offered by the landowner/developer and we go from there.”",N/A,planning@cochrane.ca,51.206667,-114.466944

Naming Principles <br>• Naming of Municipal Assets shall be based on one or more of the following priorities: <br>• geographical, neighbourhood and historical elements related to the area or street in which the property or building is located to provide a geographical association to help the public to locate a park, bridge, building or other element more easily; <br>• unique environmental characteristics or attributes; i.e. the most dominant ""constant feature either within or nearby"" the selected site such as an associated significant ecological or natural resource feature; <br>• a person or family who has made a significant contribution to the community i.e. an historical name related to Brantford's heritage and/or historical folklore; <br>• an event or person of international, provincial or national significance; <br>• a group or community organization who have made a significant contribution to development of a Municipal Asset; and/or sponsorships related to the development and/or enhancement of a property or building. <br>• Use of a person’s, family or organization’s name requires written consent from the individual, a family member or their descendant; Names shall be unique; name duplication and similar sounding or spelled names shall be avoided. <br>• Names should give a sense of place, continuity, and belonging and celebrate the distinguishing characteristics and uniqueness of Brantford. <br>• Names should promote pride in the City of Brantford, acknowledge local heritage, history, and recognize unique features and geography (such as names that relate to local history, places, and events, native wildlife, flora, fauna and natural features or unique characteristics of a neighbourhood or area). <br>• Names shall not be discriminatory, derogatory or political in nature; names conveying a secondary negative or offensive connotation, any sexual overtones, inappropriate humour, slang or double meanings shall be avoided. <br>• Names shall assist with emergency response situations by being consistent with street names and geographical locations. <br>• Names with hyphens, apostrophes or dashes shall be discouraged but may be considered on an individual basis. <br>• Names may honour the significant contributions of an individual, family, group or organization. <br>• The cost associated with a naming/renaming (including but not limited to signage, ceremonial costs, legal costs, etc.) will be the responsibility of the City when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the City and will be the responsibility of the community or corporate entity when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the community/corporate entity. <br>• Names associated with sponsorship will be considered when a donation amount relates to the valuation of the Naming Right for a facility, park or amenity thereof, in accordance with the Corporate Sponsorship and Donation Policy - 038. <br>• Naming in honour of elected or appointed public officials shall not occur while the individual is a sitting member on City Council and only when a member has served a total of ten or more years on Brantford City Council. <br>• Naming in honour of staff shall occur post-employment or posthumously. <br>• Municipal Assets are not intended to include the amenities and/or functions of memorial purposes normally found at cemeteries. Requests related to this type of memorial shall be referred to programs such as Commemorative Bench and Tree Program as outlined below. <br>• Council shall retain the right not to name certain facilities of broad community importance such as (but not limited to) City Hall. Specific Criteria for Commemorative Naming Where the commemorative naming of a Municipal Asset, is being requested, at least one of the following criteria shall apply: <br>• The nominated individual shall have demonstrated excellence, courage or exceptional service to the citizens of the City of Brantford, the Province of Ontario and/or Canada, including veterans of military conflicts; <br>• The nominated individual shall have an extraordinary community service record; <br>• The nominated individual shall have worked to foster equality and reduce discrimination or has historical significance; <br>• A direct relationship or association that existed between the place of residence of or community efforts undertaken by the individual and the property, building or element to be named; <br>• An individual, family or business may be recognized for a significant financial contribution to a park or facility, where that contribution significantly benefits the community that the park or facility serves. in accordance with the Sponsorship and Donation Corporate Policy 038; <br>• An individual who has achieved significant personal accomplishments in sports, arts, culture, science, education, business development, etc. which has resulted in positive recognition for the City of Brantford. Where the name of an individual or organization is used, approval in writing shall be obtained from the individual (his/her family) or the organization for such naming where possible. Renaming of Commemoratively Named Assets The names of Municipal Assets named commemoratively should not be changed unless it is found that the individual’s personal character is or was such that the continued use of their name for a Municipal Asset would not be in the best interest of the community. Process The naming process for Municipal Assets may involve a different course of action depending on the circumstances surrounding the request/requirement for naming. A. Naming of a Municipal Asset Public Consultation: <br>• With each new opportunity to name a Municipal Asset the applicable Ward Councillors shall solicit input with assistance from appropriate staff, from applicable Neighbourhood Associations and/or area school students and shall hold a ward meeting to solicit input from the public. <br>• Where the Asset is in located in more than one ward, the Ward Councillors shall act jointly with a joint ward meeting being convened for the same purpose. Where an Asset is of corporate wide interest, the appropriate Ward Councillors will hold a ward meeting an invite all members of Council and the whole community to participate in the meeting to solicit naming suggestions. <br>• The Ward Councillors may choose to consult the list of historic names that is currently compiled by the Planning Department for consideration as part of this process. Selection and Recommendation of a Name: <br>• Each suggested name shall be reviewed by the Ward Councillors assisted by staff to ensure the criteria as outlined in the Naming Principles Section of this Policy are met. Staff shall assist the Ward Councillors with obtaining written approval from the selected individual, family or business for use of their name where applicable. <br>• After review of the suggested names, the Ward Councillors shall bring forward a naming recommendation to City Council through the Committee of the Whole – Operations and Administration by way of a resolution. <br>• Upon Council approval of a recommendation, the individual, family or business shall be notified (where applicable). Renaming Renaming a Municipal Asset is generally discouraged, however, where the need or desire is justified, the renaming process shall be identical to the naming process and also require City Council as the final authority for approval. Limitations The policy is not intended to address: <br>• Naming rights/Sponsorship opportunities (addressed under a separate policy); <br>• The naming of city owned facilities leased to commercial tenants; or <br>• The naming of Core facilities (City Hall, fire halls, police stations and public libraries) <br>• The naming of City streets. <br><br>B. Memorial / Dedication Programs: Memorial / Dedication Bench Program This program allows a family, company, or individual to purchase a park bench to be dedicated to recognize the passing of an individual. Program information regarding benches styles and pricing is available from the Parks and Recreation Department. In each case, a plaque recognizing the individual will be placed on the bench and the bench will be located in an area that is mutually agreeable to the purchaser and the park manager. Neither a ward meeting nor public consultation is required for these programs. Memorial / Dedication Tree Program Memorial trees will be planted in a mutually agreeable location within a park or along a city trail to recognize a person or specific event. A plaque will be installed on a rock or similar structure at the base of the tree. The plaque dimensions are detailed in the tree program information brochure available from Parks staff. The Parks and Recreation Department will make every effort to preserve and protect all dedication plaques and will provide a regular standard of care and maintenance. Dedications and memorial plaques will remain in place until the City determines the need to removed, retired or replace said Asset. The plaque and bench may be re-located at the sole discretion of the City if deemed necessary by the Manager of Park Services for safety or operational requirements. The plaque or bench may or may not be repaired or replaced due to damages caused by vandalism or natural aging. The bench may be removed by the City without notice for reasons of public safety or vandalism. Memorial / Dedication Plaques A plaque may be installed in a City park or other facility dedicated to an individual or significant event. The size and placement of these plaques shall be reviewed and approved by City staff. Plaques may be installed to recognize the following: <br>• a financial contribution to the City (per Corporate Sponsorship Policy038); <br>• an event of historical significance; <br>• local or special events; <br>• a geographic location; <br>• environmental recognition; <br>• a room or specific area of a facility or City park. Placing of Plaque(s) on Municipal Buildings Approval must be obtained from City Council before any plaque is placed on a Municipally owned building. Staff will approve the design and naming of the plaque prior to Council approval. In the event that a major project such as construction of a significant municipal building is commenced during the term of one Council and completed during the term of a subsequent Council, consideration can be given to including the names of those responsible for commencing the project and those responsible for its completion.",N/A,clerks@brantford.ca,43.1449,-80.30072

All names approved by Council will be added to the Street Name Bank and made available for selection. Names that Council does not support will not be added to the street name bank. The Council decision is final. SELECTION OF STREET NAMES The Street Name Bank is an approved list of available street names. In addition, any suggested street names that have been approved by the Council (and upon completion of consultation with the Halton Regional emergency service partners) will be included in the Street Name Bank. The Street Name Bank may also include locational restrictions related to particular street names. The development community must first use any Historical Names that Council has determined appropriate for the new development area.

Citizens of London contribute to this campaign for numerous reasons including being recognized through receiving appreciation from the City and/or having their name located on a plaque board or on a particular feature of the building or park. Donations made for a building campaign are usually collected by a community group toward the project. <br><br>The names of the Mayor, the appropriate Standing Committee of Council and Ward Councillors may be noted on a recognition plaque when the names are those of the Council which approved the project. <br><br>b) A Civic Recognition <br><br>A civic recognition may be requested by a member of the public or may be initiated by the City itself to recognize a group or an individual’s outstanding accomplishments, involvement or work in the local community or in a provincial or national forum. <br><br>c) International, National or Provincial Events/Competitions <br><br>A naming or re-naming of a building or an amenity within it in recognition of it being a venue for international, national or provincial events/competitions will occur to fulfill a condition agreed to by the City as part of its hosting obligations. Council may also consider the naming or re-naming of such a facility or amenity to recognize an individual, group or corporation who donates significantly toward meeting the cost of hosting the event/competition. The naming or re-naming may be for the duration of a specified number of years, at any time after which Council in its sole discretion may re-name the building or amenity. <br><br>d)  New Park Development <br><br>Planning and Economic Development is responsible for naming new parks which are developed as part of the subdivision development process. The names selected for new parks continue the current naming/re-naming practice adopting the area, subdivision or planning district name in which the park is located to provide a geographical association to help the public to locate the park more easily. <br><br>e) Corporate Sponsorship <br><br>The City’s Corporate Sponsorship and Advertising Policy outlines the situations and specific application criteria. It applies to all business relationships between The Corporation of the City of London and businesses which contribute either financially or in-kind to City programs, services or facilities in return for recognition, public acknowledgement or other promotional considerations. Only for cases of sponsorship which have an associated sunset clause, will a corporate name or advertising brand be used. <br><br>4.5 Types of Naming Situations Not Covered by This Policy <br><br>The following situations are not covered by this policy: <br><br>a) the recognition of fallen Fire Fighters and Fire Stations;  <br><br>b) Individual naming dedications made to a person to celebrate a special occasion such as: <br><br>i) a birth; <br><br>ii) a marriage; <br><br>iii) an anniversary; <br><br>iv) an accomplishment;  <br><br>v) a major landmark event, person(s) such as a retirement or happenings. <br><br>Options for individual naming dedications can be found for naming of park features covered under The Commemorative Park Bench and Tree Program and The Storybook Gardens Brick Naming Program. Commemorative street namings are addressed through the Commemorative Street Name program. Requests for naming dedications will not be granted for memorial purposes normally found at cemeteries nor will they be granted for elected officials currently in office. <br><br>4.6  Application and Review Process <br><br>a)  Applicant(s) shall submit a written request for a civic naming to the City Clerk.

The applicant(s) is responsible for securing consensus within the community with respect to the application. Opposition to the application must be addressed and resolved by the applicant(s). <br><br>b) Upon receipt of an application, the City Clerk shall: <br><br>i) review the application for conformity with this policy; <br><br>ii) circulate the application to the appropriate internal stakeholders for comment on the suitability of the application, which would include: <br><br>the Municipal Addressing Advisory Group (MAAG) which is comprised of representatives from Planning and Development Services, City Clerk's Office, Environment and Infrastructure Services, and Emergency Service providers (Fire, Police and Ambulance) to review all proposed external civic names for the purpose of minimizing confusion for emergency response situations; <br><br>Planning and Economic Development Services, Parks and Recreation, and Neighbourhood, Children and Fire Services - for new park development naming, park re-naming and park elements; <br><br>Environmental and Engineering Services - for bridge naming; and, <br><br>Parks and Recreation and Neighbourhood, Children and Fire Services - for recreational facility naming. <br><br>c) consult with external stakeholders in the community and identify possible objections and/or positive responses and determine the level of support for the requested civic naming; <br><br>d) determine whether or not a special event is planned to coincide with a formal naming ceremony; <br><br>e) submit a report with the appropriate recommendation to the appropriate Standing Committee of Council to either approve or not approve the naming/re-naming as requested by the applicant(s).

As an example, contests for naming are considered as a special circumstance requiring approval by the appropriate Standing Committee of Council. <br><br>4.8 Civic Renaming <br><br>The City of London believes that existing names have a historical significance and place within the community and should not be changed unless it is an exceptional situation and it can be proven that the majority of the local community is in support of the change. Each application for re-naming will be examined on a case by case basis, and the following considerations shall apply: <br><br>a) Priority for re-naming will be granted by City Council in instances where a re-naming is a condition of the awarding of an International, National or Provincial Event/Competition and/or the duration of time agreed upon as part of this condition has expired. <br><br>b) Civic names may be changed if there are specific circumstances that arise which warrant a review. <br><br>c) The re-naming of an entire building or property could include: <br><br>i) adding another new name to the existing name; or, <br><br>ii) subdividing or portioning off a particular property or feature to be given a new name or sub name; or, <br><br>iii) placing the names of an organization (or individuals) on a plaque to recognize their contributions if it is found that it is inappropriate to name a particular property or building in its entirety. <br><br>4.9  Corporate Sponsorship Naming/Renaming <br><br>In addition to the general civic renaming considerations noted in part 4.8, above, corporate sponsorship naming/renaming initiatives shall: <br><br>a) have a specific sunset clause associated with the length of time that the corporate name will be used, with no guarantee of perpetuity; <br><br>b) consider the significance of the contribution made relative to the construction and operating cost of the property that is the subject of the naming; <br><br>c) require the sponsor to pay for the signage, unless the City has requested the name change;  <br><br>d) not be limited to this policy in those circumstances where there are more appropriate ways of recognizing a sponsorship, such as internal facility naming, the dedication of plaques at a facility such as the use of donor plaque boards, or the purchase of park features such as trees, benches and picnic tables",N/A,mayor@london.ca,43.083889,-81.298611

The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance on process when considering Commemorative Street Naming proposals while ensuring legal street names are maintained. Process/Procedures: 1)	 Any citizen, group of citizens, entity or organization may submit a written request to the City to supplement an existing street name by the Commemorative Naming of Streets. 2)	 The contributions of individuals, groups, entities or organizations must be well documented and acknowledged within the community.

Names given to municipal facilities, parks, properties, features and other amenities in the City of Welland will cease through the expiration of the life cycle of the above-mentioned entity, unless a renaming initiative is commenced and approved in accordance with the requirements of this policy. In such cases, the renaming, when approved, will cease at the expiration of the life cycle of the entity. The application of this policy includes four main types of naming situations: <br>• the opening of a new municipal facility, park, property or feature. <br>• the re-opening of a municipal facility, park, property or feature following renovation or refurbishment. <br>• the renaming of an existing facility, park, property or feature to recognize significant contributions that organizations or individuals have made to the public and well-being of the City of Welland. <br>• providing recognition of gifts generously given or donated to the City. This policy is not intended to address naming situations related to sponsorships or naming rights sold, usually for a specific term, as part of a naming partnership involving agreements normally comprised of a variety of benefits and opportunities for both the sponsor and the municipality. <br><br>NAMING CRITERIA AND GUIDELINES All proposed names for any municipal facilities, property, features and amenities shall conform to the majority of the following guidelines; <br>•	 Names should give a sense of place, continuity, belonging and celebrate distinguishing characteristics and uniqueness of Welland. <br>•	 Names should maintain a long-standing local area identification with residents of Welland. <br>•	 Names should be consistent with any other applicable City of Welland policies and standards <br>•	 Names which reflect and/or imply a reference to any of the following WILL NOT be eligible; names of living individuals unless by exception approved by Council or as a result of a significant financial contribution made by a donor; political affiliation; derogatory or offensive terms or references; discrimination against race, gender, ethnicity, or creed; duplication; tobacco or alcoholic products; names considered inappropriate for a civic amenity or inconsistent with the Corporate Strategic Directions and/or Vision for the City. In addition to the previously mentioned restrictions and guidelines, the City of Welland has three accepted categories for the selection of names for municipal facilities, properties, features and amenities. The three accepted categories do not apply to naming requests acknowledging significant financial gifts. The three accepted categories are geographic, historic and prominent individuals and/or organizations. GEOGRAPHIC - Names having a geographical affiliation, which may include but are not limited to the following references; <br>•	 a neighborhood, community, or subdivision . <br>•	 an adjacent street <br>•	 a noteworthy physical, environmental or scenic quality <br>•	 an unique site characteristic or scenic quality <br>•	 proximity to a recognized facility or area <br>•	 topographical or ecological characteristics HISTORIC - Names having a historical affiliation, which may include but are not limited to the following references; <br>•	 a local or national historical event <br>•	 a heritage event PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS AND/OR ORGANIZATIONS - Names affiliated with individuals and/or organizations, the following criteria will be used to weigh the suitability of the name being proposed; <br>•	 individuals or families having a historical connection to the site (such as a previous landowner) <br>•	 individuals and/or organizations having a significant contribution to the community/City in one or more of the following areas; 1) Service as an elected representative to the municipal, provincial or federal government for at least two terms 2) Service as a member of a public board, committee or commission 3) Service in a voluntary capacity in community organizations such as service clubs, cultural groups, unions, ethnic organizations, community associations, professional organizations, etc. 4) Service in a voluntary or philanthropic capacity or having made a significant contribution in the areas of agriculture, arts and culture, co-operatives, education, business or industry, journalism, medicine, politics, religion, science, public service, recreation or sports on a local, provincial, national or international scale. In those cases where names are affiliated with individuals and/or organizations, the following criteria must be met; <br>•	 The contributions of the individual and/or organization must be well documented and broadly acknowledged within the community <br>•	 To the extent where possible, a direct relationship should exist between the individual and/or organization and the amenity being considered for naming/renaming. <br>•	 The reputation of the individual and/or organization must be honorable, as the term implies, to be considered for naming/renaming. <br>•	 Where an amenity is to be named/renamed after someone who is deceased, permission and agreement must be obtained from the next of kin or legal representative involved prior to consideration and review by the City. Where the names of deceased individuals are being considered, a five year waiting period after the death of the individual must be observed before considering the name for commemoration in naming such amenity. The rationale for this is to ensure that amenities are not precipitously named/renamed in the initial emotional outpourings after the death of a public figure or prominent individual. The names of living persons shall not be permitted unless used in the recognition of a significant financial contribution or by exception approved by Council. DONOR RECOGNITION - SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL GIFTS The City of Welland will consider naming a public amenity as a means of providing recognition for significant financial gifts to the City, in accordance with this and other applicable city policies. The guidelines under the NAMING CRITERIA - GENERAL GUIDELINES section will apply. The term ""SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL GIFT"" implies a minimum monetary donation of 35% of the total real or capital cost or appraised value, whichever is greater, of the amenity being considered for naming/renaming. The names of living individuals may be used in recognition of significant financial gifts. The City of Welland reserves the right to immediately withdraw a name from an amenity should that name come into disrepute in the City or in the general community. RENAMING OF EXISTING MUNICIPAL AMENITIES Recognizing that established names contribute significantly to community identity and pride, proposals to rename existing municipal amenities must be predicated by exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, existing names will not be changed without the considering the historical significance of the existing name; the impact on the individual and/or organization associated with the existing name or; the cost and impact of changing the existing signage, rebuilding community recognition and updating records (data bases, letterhead, promotional materials, etc.). All renaming requests must be submitted in the same format as listed in the section SUBMISSION PROCESS. Where a name/renaming change is recommended, a communication strategy will be initiated by advertising the proposed change on the City’s website and Civic Corner for a period of 30 days during which time, public comments will be received and considered. Additionally, the costs associated with the naming/renaming initiative will be the responsibility of the City when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the City and will be the responsibility of the individual and/or organization when the naming/renaming has been initiated by the individual and/or organization.

RÈGLES DE DÉNOMINATION 5.1 Critères d’analyse dictés par la Ville - Relation entre le nom et le lieu qu’il désigne - Favoriser les noms ayant un lien logique, étroit et d’intérêt avec le lieu; - Tenir compte de la nature et de l’usage du lieu (voie, parc, place publique, immeuble, contexte résidentiel, commercial, industriel ou culturel, etc.); - Tenir compte des caractéristiques géographiques naturelles du lieu (faune, flore, géologie, etc.); - Tenir compte de l’histoire du quartier en termes urbain (usages actuels ou passés) et social (pionniers, longévité familiale sur les lieux, anecdotes); - Tenir compte des traditions du milieu local ou régional (surnom du lieu). - Originalité, valeur poétique et euphonie (harmonie des sons) - Favoriser les noms inspirant des images fortes; - Préserver les régionalismes; - Éviter les toponymes banals et utilisés fréquemment; - Éviter les toponymes servant de désignation publicitaire. - Sentiment d’appartenance - Favoriser les noms mettant en valeur l’identité amossoise, les lieux d’appartenance et le caractère du milieu dans lequel il s’inscrit. Mise en valeur du patrimoine culturel - Favoriser les noms issus de l’histoire et du patrimoine local, régional ou national (référence à une personne, un fait ou un événement); - Honorer une seule fois une même personne ou chose. - Point de repère - Tenir compte de la toponymie existante; - Favoriser les noms permettant de se repérer plus facilement; - Éviter les homonymes et les doublons. - Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne : - Favoriser le nom de personnes ayant contribué de façon significative au développement, au dynamisme ou au bien-être de la communauté; - Privilégier le nom sous lequel la personne est la mieux connue (nom complet, titre accompagné du nom complet, pseudonyme, etc.); - Retenir le nom complet de la personne (prénom et nom de famille); - Recourir au nom de famille seul pour honorer une famille complète. <br><br>5.2 Critères de choix prescrits par la Commission Le nom doit respecter les règles d’écriture et être conforme aux critères de choix de la Commission. - Unicité du nom de lieu Un seul nom officiel est attribué à tout lieu ou entité géographique. - Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage courant est le mieux établi, autrement dit, les noms et les expressions répandus par la tradition orale sont favorisés. Ex. : Les locutions « rang du Précieux-Sang » et « Bac-passeur » qui se réfèrent respectivement à la 1re Rue Est au-delà du secteur des écoles et à la structure qui reliait les deux rives de l’Harricana avant la construction du pont Desmarais, existent dans la tradition orale amossoise, mais n’ont jamais été officialisés dans la toponymie municipale. - Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. - Langue de l’élément spécifique Les noms communs composant de nouveaux toponymes sont en français. Il est possible de conserver la langue d’origine d’un nom commun s’il a une valeur culturelle ou historique. - Présence et unicité du générique Le nom d’une voie de communication, d’un parc public, d’un édifice ou d’une autre construction comporte toujours un générique. - Utilisation de génériques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de l’Office québécois de la langue française). - Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. - Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel est utilisé pour composer un autre toponyme, il doit en respecter la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques. Ex. : Le nom officiel « Lac Beauchamp » est repris de façon intégrale dans le nom « chemin du Lac-Beauchamp ».",N/A,luce.cardinal@amos.quebec,48.566667,-78.116667

quebec_farnham,,record,Farnham,Quebec,Yes,"Critères de choix toponymiques de la Ville Unicité du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou entité géographique ne se voit attribuer qu’un seul nom officiel. Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils ne dérogent pas à d’autres critères. Dans les cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. Toutefois, en ce qui concerne les entités naturelles, la langue du générique peut ne pas être française si l’importance du lieu désigné est locale et si le nom de ce lieu est en usage exclusivement dans cette langue autre que française. Langue de l’élément spécifique Sauf exception justifiable, il est de règle de conserver dans leur langue les mots de la langue générale qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. On officialise dans leur langue d’origine les spécifiques des toponymes amérindiens et inuits. Pour leur part, les points cardinaux inclus dans les odonymes et qui renseignent sur l’identité d’un tronçon par rapport à un autre ou sur la direction de la voie sont en français. Dans les cas d’usages concurrents d’une forme française et d’une forme dans une autre langue, le Comité privilégie la première si l’usage local en est significatif. Par ailleurs, les mots de la langue générale qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes créés par le Comité sont en français. Présence et unité du générique Un nom d’entité naturelle ou artificielle comporte habituellement un générique. Un odonyme en comprend toujours un. Un nom d’entité administrative peut en comporter lorsque le lieu désigné n’est pas une Ville, un autre lieu habité ou un lieu-dit. Cependant, un nom géographique ne peut comprendre plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction d’un générique. Utilisation de génériques conformes Les noms d’entités administratives et les noms nouveaux de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques. Les génériques des noms attribués à des entités naturelles innommées peuvent être différents des termes consacrés par les avis terminologiques dans une volonté de promotion de la langue française du Québec en tant qu’élément du patrimoine, de renforcement de l’image suggérée par le lieu lui-même, de meilleure intégration du toponyme créé aux éléments génériques présents dans le milieu ou encore afin de respecter un usage historique. Noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an Un lieu peut se voir attribuer un nom commémoratif d’après celui d’une personne vivante et ayant une importance historique certaine ou un lien étroit avec le lieu à désigner. Seuls les noms de personnes décédées depuis plus d’un an peuvent faire l’objet d'une officialisation auprès de la Commission de Toponymie du Québec. Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte intégralement la forme. Utilisation d’un nom de rue en lien avec le lieu à commémorer Certains noms facilitent le ""repérage"" de lieux par les citoyens et les visiteurs. Lorsque possible, le Comité doit s’assurer, lors de l’utilisation d’un nom, qu’il existe un lien certain entre ce nom et son environnement immédiat. Utilisation du mot ""Famille"" dans la dénomination La Ville n’est pas favorable à l’utilisation du mot ""Famille"" dans la graphie d’un nom. Utilisation de plusieurs prénoms pour un même nom de famille La Ville n'est pas favorable à l'utilisation d'un nom de famille avec divers prénoms. Utilisation du nom de fille d’une femme mariée L’utilisation pour une commémoration du nom de fille d’une femme mariée demeure une approche répandue. Dans cette démarche les personnes honorées ne sont pas très connues ou seulement localement. Toutefois, lorsque certaines femmes sont de notoriété reconnue et utilisent le nom de famille de leur mari, c’est cette désignation qui devrait généralement être retenue. Similitude quant à l’écriture et la prononciation Lors de la fusion municipale de mars 2000, il avait été souligné le problème de la coexistence de noms identiques ou présentant des similitudes quant à l’écriture et la prononciation, ce qui aurait pu engendrer des risques d’erreurs et porter atteinte à la sécurité de la population. Encore aujourd’hui, le choix de nouvelles dénominations doit tenir compte de ce facteur. Utilisation de l’initiale La Ville n’est pas favorable à l’utilisation de l’initiale du prénom d’un personnage à commémorer. Voie de circulation limitrophe entre deux zones résidentielles Une voie de circulation, qui divise deux zones résidentielles limitrophes dont les thématiques sont différentes, peut recevoir un nom sans lien direct avec l'une ou l'autre des deux thématiques. Impartialité de la Ville D’un point de vue toponymique, la Ville doit demeurer impartiale face aux organismes militants, qu’il s’agisse de groupes religieux, politiques ou autres. En tant que corps municipal au service de tous les citoyens, la Ville doit faire preuve de neutralité pour ne pas donner l’impression qu’elle privilégie un groupe au détriment d’un autre, ni n’endosse de positions politiques ou religieuses défendues par des groupes d’intérêt. Nombre de commémoration pour une personne De façon générale, la Ville honore une seule fois une même personne. Il peut arriver que seul le nom de famille soit utilisé pour honorer cette personne. Dans ce cas, le nom au complet ne pourrait être repris, car la commémoration existe déjà.",Appplication form: https://www.ville.farnham.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Politique-de-denomination-toponymique.pdf,alevesque@ville.farnham.qc.ca,45.283333,-72.983333

À noter que dans le cas d’une recommandation favorable, le Comité de toponymie demande préalablement un avis technique à la Commission de toponymie, afin de s’assurer du respect des règles d’écriture établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec. 5.3 Décision du conseil municipal Le conseil municipal reçoit et analyse la recommandation du Comité de toponymie (en fonction des critères d’analyse et de choix des noms des lieux établis dans la présente Politique). Par la suite, le conseil municipal adopte une résolution par laquelle ce dernier accepte ou refuse la demande de dénomination toponymique. 5.4 Suivi des décisions du conseil municipal Dans le cas d’un refus de la demande de dénomination toponymique par le conseil municipal, le Comité de toponymie en informe le requérant et ferme la demande de dénomination toponymique. Dans le cas d’une acceptation de la demande de dénomination toponymique par le conseil municipal, le Comité de toponymie transmet la résolution (et tout autre document jugé nécessaire et pertinent à la demande) à la Commission de toponymie du Québec en vue de demander l’officialisation du toponyme auprès de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. 5.5 Liste des noms de lieux En tout temps, le Comité de toponymie s’assure de gérer et de tenir à jour une banque de noms pour de futures dénominations toponymiques. <br><br>6. CRITÈRES D’ANALYSE L’analyse du choix des noms des lieux se fait selon les critères suivants : Normes générales 1. Unicité du nom de lieu : Tout lieu se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel; 2. Usage : Les toponymes dont l’usage populaire est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils ne dérogent pas à d’autres critères. Dans le cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères; 3. Langue de l’élément générique : L’élément générique est en français; 4. Langue de l’élément spécifique : Les mots de la langue générale qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes sont en français.Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots d’une langue autre que le français qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visés par cette règle et sont écrits dans leur forme originale. Les points cardinaux inclus dans les noms de voies de communication (odonymes) qui renseignent sur la localisation d’un tronçon par rapport à un autre ou sur la direction de la voie sont en français; 5. Présence et unicité du générique : Un nom d’entité naturelle ou artificielle comporte habituellement un générique. Un odonyme comporte toujours un générique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction de générique; 6. Utilisation de génériques conformes : Les lieux et odonymes doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de l’Office québécois de la langue française); 7. Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an : Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. Le nom proposé rend hommage à une personnalité qui a apporté une contribution significative au développement, au dynamisme ou au bien-être de la communauté de la Ville de Bromont; 8. Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel : Lorsqu’on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques; <br><br>Sources inspirantes recommandées 9. Ressources historiques et folkloriques du milieu : Pour la désignation de lieux, il convient de s’inspirer des faits des événements et des personnages historiques ou folkloriques qui ont marqué la vie locale ou régionale; 10. Ressources de la géographie : La dénomination de lieux tire avantage de s’inspirer des caractéristiques du milieu naturel environnant (flore, faune, géologie, etc.); 11. Préservation des régionalismes : Il importe d’accorder un soin particulier à la préservation des régionalismes dans la toponymie; 12. Désignations commémoratives : Des personnes, des organismes, des collectivités ou des événements peuvent faire l’objet de désignations commémoratives s’ils ont joué un rôle important pour la communauté québécoise; 13. Noms de personnes : Lorsqu’on honore la mémoire d’une personne par l’attribution de son nom à un lieu, on devrait privilégier le nom sous lequel elle est la mieux connue; il peut s’agir d’un nom complet ou d’une forme usuelle. Le choix de l’anthroponyme commémoratif doit permettre d’identifier correctement la personne honorée. On s’efforce généralement de retenir le nom complet de la personne (prénom(s) et nom de famille); <br><br>Pratiques contre-indiquées 14. Désignations péjoratives, grossières ou suscitant la dissension : On doit éviter l’emploi de noms à connotation péjorative ou grossière, de même que les choix susceptibles de provoquer ou d’alimenter une dissension; 15. Noms banals ou utilisés fréquemment : On doit éviter l’emploi de noms trop banals et ceux dont l’existence est largement répandue. Certains noms servent à désigner un grand nombre d’entités géographiques différentes et leur répétition peut être source de confusion. Dans toute recherche en vue de l’attribution d’un nom à un lieu innommé, il convient de s’inspirer davantage des données historiques locales et des différentes particularités morphologiques, biologiques ou autres du milieu en faisant preuve d’originalité, afin d’éviter d’ajouter à la prolifération de noms fréquemment utilisés et rendus banals; 16. Désignations publicitaires : On doit éviter d’attribuer des noms qui peuvent servir de réclame à des marques de commerce ou à des entreprises commerciales ou industrielles; 17. Désignations numériques, alphabétiques et alphanumériques : Il faut éviter d’utiliser des nombres et des lettres comme base de dénomination des lieux. Cependant, le cas échéant, il convient d’utiliser la forme ordinale (l’adjectif numéral) plutôt que la forme cardinale (le nombre pur); 18. Points cardinaux : L’utilisation de points cardinaux est à éviter, à moins qu’ils ne désignent de façon précise une entité ou qu’ils ne fassent partie d’un toponyme existant. Pour former de nouveaux toponymes, on peut bien sûr utiliser des toponymes qui en comportent déjà; 19. Juxtaposition de toponymes : On devrait éviter de créer des toponymes en juxtaposant des spécifiques toponymiques ou des toponymes entiers si cela est de nature à produire des noms géographiques dont la longueur rend leur utilisation difficile; <br><br>Autres : 20. Doublon et homonyme : Deux lieux ne doivent pas porter le même nom ni un nom semblable, dans le but d’éviter la redondance et le risque de confusion engendrés par l’existence de doublons et d’homonymes, à l’exception des lieux contigus; 21. Ambiguïté : Toute ambiguïté dans la dénomination doit être évitée afin d’assurer la sécurité reliée à la recherche d’une adresse civique pour les services d’urgence (ambulancier, policier, pompier, etc.); 22. Remplacement d’un nom par un autre : Dans le cas où se présente une suggestion de remplacement d’un nom par un autre, le statu quo doit être privilégié, à moins qu’une démonstration claire ne soit faite indiquant que le changement comporte de grands avantages, qu’il est sans préjudice pour autrui et qu’il a une valeur patrimoniale ou historique; 23. Caractère logique de la dénomination : Il existe un lien pertinent entre le toponyme proposé et le lieu à nommer. Dans le cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronçons devraient autant que possible porter le nom des tronçons existants; 24. Sentiment d’appartenance : Le nom proposé est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment d’appartenance à la Ville de Bromont. Il met en valeur l’identité bromontoise, le patrimoine et l’histoire locale les lieux d’appartenance; 25. Représentativité des femmes : Le nom proposé vise à améliorer la représentativité des femmes dans la toponymie bromontoise, en tenant notamment compte de l’importance et de la superficie du lieu nommé; 26. Thématique : Le choix ou le maintien d’une thématique spécifique est favorisé pour un secteur ou partie de secteur dans la dénomination des nouvelles rues et des parcs et espaces verts. 27. Règles d’écriture : Les règles d’écriture établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec doivent être respectées;",N/A,ville@bromont.com,45.316667,-72.65

Parks and green spaces <br><br>Specific eligibility conditions: <br><br>The municipal council may name or rename its parks and green spaces: <br><br>4.1. In honor of a person: <br><br>Having stood out on the local scene by carrying out a major project or defending a cause that is particularly important to the community; <br><br>Having been deceased for at least two years. <br><br>4.2. In memory of an event that will have greatly marked the community. <br><br>In the case of certain parks or spaces whose name is associated with local organizations, any changes must be made in collaboration with the organizations concerned. <br><br>The City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will allow citizens at any time to submit nominations to honor new personalities based on the criteria of this category. <br><br>Process and general eligibility <br><br>The program has five categories for which criteria are defined. <br><br>1. Enhancement of current names <br>2. New developments <br>3. Naming of public buildings and major infrastructures <br>4. Parks and green spaces <br>5. Forecourt of starry blueberries <br><br>In all cases, it is the municipal council that makes the decision to rename a building, an infrastructure, a green space or any other place under its jurisdiction. The latter may consult the community and, when applicable, must formalize its procedures with the Commission de toponymie du Québec. As soon as it is adopted in 2017, the City will provide citizens with web forms to suggest the candidacy of new personalities for categories 4 and 5. <br><br>With regard to categories 3, 4 and 5, each toponymic recognition or commemoration action will be accompanied by a civic reception and the signing of the City's guestbook. In addition, the City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will take steps to allow citizens to have access to the biography of the personalities thus honored, in particular by posting them in the Bank of Place Names of Québec, on the site of the Commission de toponymie. <br><br>General eligibility requirements: <br><br>To be eligible for any category of this program, a person must be considered a Dolmissoise or a Dolmissois. For the purposes of this document, a Dolmissoise is a person born in Dolbeau-Mistassini, who has lived there or who has evolved within a local group for at least 10 years. <br><br>Category of interventions <br><br>1. Highlighting current names <br><br>Several streets in Dolbeau-Mistassini already bear names reflecting the history of the city. The first category of this program will consist of highlighting current odonyms, thanks to the collaboration of the Maria-Chapdelaine History and Genealogy Society. <br><br>The City of Dolbeau-Mistassini will therefore take the following measures: <br><br>Formalize the origin of the names of thoroughfares with the Commission de toponymie du Québec and ensure their distribution in the Bank of place names of Québec. <br><br>Allow the History and Genealogy Society to publish and sell a guide listing all the odonyms of the city of Dolbeau-Mistassini. <br><br>To consult the list of official toponyms in Dolbeau-Mistassini, consult the website of the Commission de toponymie du Québec .  <br><br>2. New developments <br><br>When the previously developed urban planning logic allows it, the choice of street names for new developments gives preponderance to the pioneers of Dolbeau-Mistassini who contributed in its beginnings to founding the former towns of Dolbeau and Mistassini, and this , more precisely between 1892 and 1950. The toponymic proposals provided by the Maria-Chapdelaine Historical and Genealogical Society are mainly used as a reference for this category. <br><br>3.

quebec_coaticook,,record,Coaticook,Quebec,Yes,"1.2 Objectifs La présente politique vise à :  Mettre en valeur l’histoire et le patrimoine de la Ville de Coaticook par la dénomination de ses rues, de ses routes, de ses chemins, de ses bâtiments, de ses lieux et de toute autre entité géographique;  Éliminer toute ambiguïté dans la dénomination afin d’assurer la sécurité reliée à la recherche d’une adresse civique pour divers services (ambulancier, policier, incendie, etc.).  Développer le sentiment d’appartenance des citoyens par la dénomination;  Établir une démarche respectueuse avant de procéder à une dénomination. <br><br>4.0 PROCÉDURE Toute requête de dénomination reçue par la Ville de Coaticook est acheminée au comité de toponymie. Le comité de toponymie analyse la demande et transmet, au besoin, sa recommandation au conseil municipal. Dans le cas d’une décision favorable par ce dernier, la résolution est transmise à la Commission de toponymie du Québec, qui officialise la nomination. Celle-ci entre en vigueur lors de la réception d’une réponse d’officialisation de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. La Ville achemine alors l’information aux services concernés (urbanisme, travaux publics, communication, culture, Poste Canada) Si la proposition ne peut être attribuée à court terme, elle est alors insérée à la banque de noms. 5.0 RÈGLES DE DÉNOMINATION Avant de choisir un nom pour un lieu donné, les aspects suivants sont examinés :  La nature du lieu : voie, parc, place publique ou immeuble;  les qualités du lieu à nommer : sa fonction, sa localisation géographique et son contexte, qu’il soit résidentiel, commercial, industriel ou culturel;  l’histoire du quartier sur les plans urbain et social;  la toponymie existante : afin d’éviter les doublons ou homonymes, et d’harmoniser les nouvelles désignations avec le patrimoine toponymique du secteur;  le profil biographique de la personne dont la mémoire est honorée;  l’importance de certains événements et leur impact social;  l’association naturelle entre la personne, la communauté résidante concernée et le lieu à nommer 5.1 Critères fondamentaux La politique de désignation toponymique et odonymique doit permettre d’identifier le meilleur choix de toponymes en s’appuyant sur certains critères fondamentaux soit :  Éviter les dénominations dépourvues de tout contenu culturel ;  Tenir compte du contenu enrichissant qu’offre les noms issus de l’histoire et du patrimoine local ou national ;  Éviter le choix d’un nom dont l’attribution pourrait provoquer une controverse ;  Éviter les noms à consonance semblable (homonyme) ou doublons qui pourrait confondre le repérage par les services d’urgence ;  Faciliter le repérage du lieu nommé ;  Honorer une seule fois une même personne ;  Exclure les noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an ;  Attribuer un seul nom officiel à tout lieu ou entité géographique. <br><br>5.2 Critères spécifiques Pour la dénomination des voies de communication (rue, chemin, sentiers) ainsi que des édifices municipaux, places publiques ou monuments, il est important que l’attribution d’un nom soit représentative du milieu historique, culturel ou communautaire. Ainsi, il est recommandé de fixer le choix sur les critères suivants :  Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particulièrement illustrées au sein de leur communauté ;  Favoriser le nom des pionniers qui ont bâti la municipalité ;  Favoriser le nom de l’ancêtre d’une famille ancienne ;  Favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement de la ville ;  Éviter la nomination désignant seulement la fonction de l’édifice. Pour la désignation des parcs et espaces verts municipaux, dont les principaux utilisateurs sont les gens du milieu environnant, il convient de suivre les critères suivants:  Premièrement, donner le nom de la rue adjacente au parc pour permettre un meilleure repérage de celui-ci par les usagers ;  Deuxièmement, favoriser le nom de l’ancêtre d’une famille ancienne ayant habité dans le secteur concerné ou ;  Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particulièrement illustrées au sein de leur communauté dans le secteur visé, ou dans la municipalité.",N/A,s.lavertu@coaticook.ca,45.133333,-71.8

MISSION S’assurer que le territoire du Québec est nommé avec justesse et qu’il met en valeur le visage français du Québec. MANDAT Créée en 1977 en vertu de la Charte de la langue française, la Commission doit : <br>• proposer au gouvernement les normes et les règles d’écriture à respecter dans la dénomination des lieux; <br>• procéder à l’inventaire et à la conservation des noms de lieux; <br>• établir et normaliser la terminologie géographique, en collaboration avec l’Office québécois de la langue française; <br>• officialiser les noms de lieux; <br>• diffuser la nomenclature géographique officielle du Québec; <br>• donner son avis au gouvernement sur toute question que celui-ci lui soumet en matière de toponymie. <br><br>Le rôle du comité consultatif d'urbanisme de la Ville de Gaspé est notamment : <br>• de faire des recommandations au conseil municipal en matière d’urbanisme et d’aménagement du territoire (mission première); <br>• d’offrir à la communauté un accès à des outils de gestion cohérents (plan d’implantation et d’intégration architecturale, dérogation mineure, etc.); <br>• de donner place à l’innovation et à l’originalité; <br>• de permettre une diversité des points de vue et accroître la participation des citoyens; <br>• de collaborer à la protection des paysages, à l’harmonisation des utilisations du sol, éviter les incompatibilités d’usage, etc. Il est important de noter que le comité consultatif d'urbanisme est un comité aviseur auprès du conseil municipal; l’acceptation ou le refus d’un projet demeure du ressort exclusif des élus municipaux. Le comité consultatif d'urbanisme de la Ville de Gaspé est formé de deux élus municipaux et de sept membres non élus choisis dans la communauté et provenant de secteurs géographiques, sociaux, économiques différents et complémentaires. De plus, certaines personnes ressources assistent le comité dans leurs travaux (directeur de l’Urbanisme, inspecteurs, aménagiste, etc.).

Lorsqu’il s’agit d’un nom commun : <br>• Tenir compte des éléments géographiques et topographiques à proximité du lieu; <br>• Privilégier les noms pouvant servir à repérer plus facilement l’endroit. Lorsqu’un nouveau développement résidentiel se présente, le comité de toponymie devrait privilégier un thème commun pour la désignation des nouvelles rues. <br><br>5.2 REMPLACEMENT D’UN NOM PAR UN AUTRE Dans le cas où se présenterait une suggestion de remplacement d’un nom par un autre, le statu quo devrait être privilégié, à moins qu’une démonstration claire ne soit présentée au comité de toponymie à l’effet que le changement comporte de grands avantages, sans préjudice pour autrui. Le remplacement d’un nom commun par un nom propre sera privilégié plutôt que l’inverse. <br><br>5.3 POSSIBILITÉ DE DONNER UN NOM D’UN ORGANISME, ENTREPRISE OU PERSONNE PRIVÉE AYANT CONTRIBUÉ FINANCIÈREMENT AU PROJET La Ville de Gaspé se réserve le droit de négocier avec des organismes, entreprises ou personnes privées qui pourraient contribuer financièrement soit à la construction d’une infrastructure ou au maintien des activités d’un lieu et qui aimeraient donner leur nom à ce lieu en échange.

quebec_carleton-sur-mer,,record,Carleton-sur-Mer,Quebec,Yes,"1. Contexte et fondements <br><br>À la suite de la fusion de la Ville de Carleton avec la municipalité de Saint-Omer, la nouvelle entité, la ville de Carleton-sur-Mer, constate la nécessité de se doter d’une politique pour la dénomination de ses rues, de ses routes, de ses chemins, de ses bâtiments, de ses lieux et places publiques ou de toute autre entité géographique. <br><br>La Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer abrite une multitude de rues, de places publiques et d’édifices qui sont désignés par une appellation les différenciant les uns des autres. Ces différentes appellations portent le nom de toponyme, terme utilisé pour désigner les noms des entités géographiques de la municipalité. <br><br>La Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer est appelée à croître au cours des prochaines années. À cet effet, de nouveaux projets de construction résidentielle et commerciale verront le jour. De plus, la Ville reçoit régulièrement des demandes de citoyens qui désirent attribuer un nom à une entité qui n’en possède pas ou proposer des appellations pour des entités futures. Enfin, l’existence de plusieurs doublons dans les noms de rues est l’une des premières raisons qui motive la municipalité à revoir l’ensemble de la dénomination à l’intérieur d’une politique qui tient compte de ce qui caractérise le milieu. <br><br>Dans le but de pouvoir gérer efficacement l’ensemble du dossier toponymique, la Corporation de l’Écomusée Tracadièche et le directeur du développement culturel à la Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer ont élaboré la présente politique dont la mise en place est destinée à améliorer la méthodologie en matière de dénomination au sein de la municipalité. <br><br>5. Mandats du directeur du développement culturel et de l’Écomusée Tracadièche <br><br>· Formuler des avis toponymiques adressés aux instances concernées; <br><br>· Coordonner la gestion et la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles; <br><br>· Verser les appellations retenues dans la banque de noms disponibles et refuser les noms jugés invalides ; <br><br>· Coordonner les actions (recherche, etc.) nécessaires à la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles; <br><br>· Consulter la population en cas de besoin, en collaboration avec les instances municipales, pour obtenir des suggestions de toponymes et connaître les préférences des citoyens; <br><br>· Assurer le bon fonctionnement des prises de décisions en tenant à jour la documentation justifiant la prise de décisions. <br><br>6. Processus <br><br>6.1 Lorsqu’elle le juge nécessaire, la Ville de Carleton-sur-Mer entend nommer ses rues, ses routes, ses chemins, ses lieux et toute autre entité géographique de la façon suivante : <br><br>· En rendant un hommage posthume à un citoyen décédé depuis au moins un an et qui a grandement contribué, par son action, au développement du milieu et de la communauté; <br><br>· En rendant un hommage posthume à un personnage considéré comme un fondateur ou un pionnier; <br><br>· En utilisant un fait historique qui relate une période ou un événement en relation avec l’histoire de la communauté ou de la région; <br><br>· En utilisant un toponyme ou un paysage exclusif au milieu. <br><br>6.2 Le Conseil de Ville consulte son directeur du service culturel et l’Écomusée Tracadièche avant de procéder à une dénomination. <br><br>6.3 La proposition toponymique est effectuée par les membres de l’Écomusée Tracadièche et le directeur du développement culturel. Un dossier est ouvert pour chaque demande ou proposition. Dans tous les cas, la recommandation doit être accompagnée d’une argumentation justifiant le choix du nom. <br><br>6.4 La préparation d’un dossier accompagne chaque proposition. L’exercice consiste à rassembler le plus de documentation possible à propos du nom proposé. Ces renseignements serviront à justifier la proposition toponymique. Cette étape du processus de dénomination toponymique a pour but d’évaluer la valeur toponymique du nom proposé et d’en déterminer la validation à l'aide de critères précis. <br><br>6.5 Un rapport est rédigé puis déposé au conseil municipal. Dans le cas où il jugerait nécessaire qu’une consultation publique soit faite, il le signifie à l’Écomusée Tracadièche et au directeur du développement culturel qui s’en chargent. <br><br>6.6 Un délai raisonnable sera accordé à l’Écomusée Tracadièche pour faire une recommandation documentée en fonction des différents paramètres de la présente politique. <br><br>6.7 Le directeur général et greffier fait ensuite valider le ou les noms retenus auprès de la commission toponymique du Québec.

ontario_meaford,,record,Meaford,Ontario,Yes,"Policy Statement The Municipality of Meaford has deemed it appropriate to establish a protocol for naming streets, parks and municipal facilities. The policy will ensure that naming opportunities are dealt with in a consistent manner. In this regard, the Street, Park and Municipal Facility Naming Policy establishes guidelines regarding naming and the establishment of an “Approved Name List”. Purpose This policy provides guidance on the method of street, park and municipal facility naming within the Municipality of Meaford. The function of naming is to enable people, and emergency services, to locate properties readily. This policy will be applied in conjunction with the civic numbering policy developed in conjunction with the County of Grey which utilizes a six digit number for rural properties and a three digit number for rural subdivisions. <br><br>Policy Requirements General Policies for Appropriate Names The following criteria will be considered for potential naming of streets, parks and facilities: Names Honouring Those Who Have Served or Given their Life in Public Service The Municipality will facilitate the naming of streets, parks and facilities after residents of the municipality who have lost their lives while serving within the Armed Forces. In addition, the Municipality may also include the name of those who lose their lives in the service of the public through either the Ontario Provincial Police or the Fire Department with the written consent of his/her immediate family. Special signage containing the Poppy symbol is to be used for all Veteran street, park and facility names. Names Honouring Individuals for Community Service, Local Historical Reasons, National Reasons or International Reasons Council may approve, upon request by an individual or proponent, a name for a street, park or facility which identifies a specific individual. Generally such a name will be of historic importance to the municipality or be a name which is of importance either nationally or internationally or lastly be a name of a person who has been of public service to the municipality or broader community. A written description of the individual’s contribution to the municipality, or broader community explaining why the honour should be given, shall be submitted by the proponent. Staff shall research names proposed by Council. The written consent of his/her immediate family is required. Names that reflect the Municipality’s Agricultural and/or Heritage/Nature Council may approve, or a proponent may request the approval of, a name which reflects the municipality’s agricultural and/or heritage/nature. A written description of the proposed name and its linkage to the area shall be submitted by the proponent. Staff shall research names proposed by Council. Other Names Other appropriate names are those that promote pride in the municipality, acknowledge local heritage and history, and recognize unique features and geography. Proposed names should meet one of following: <br>• Commemorate local history, places, events, culture. <br>• Strengthen neighbourhood identity to reflect the character of the area. <br>• Recognize native wildlife, flora, fauna, natural features. <br>• Recognize communities that contribute to the public life of the Municipality. <br>• Names that represent specific themes are encouraged as they are easily recognizable for emergency services and provide consistency in large developments. Priority for Selection of Names In assigning names, names from the “Approved Name List” should be used when selecting names for a proposed street, park or facility. The categories of this list are as follows: 1. Names Honouring Those Who Have Served Their Country 2. Names Honouring Those who have given their Life in Public Service 3. Names Honouring Individuals – Local Historical 4. Names Honouring Individuals – National or International 5. Names Honouring Individuals – Community Service 6. Names that reflect the Municipality’s Agricultural and/or Recreational Heritage/Nature 7. Other Names Specific Policies regarding Suitability of Street Names When naming a new street, in addition to the General Policies as stated in the previous section, the following shall be adhered to ensure orderly naming of streets: Ease of Spelling and Pronunciation Street names shall be easily pronounced, recognized and use conventional spelling to avoid difficulties in emergency situations. Street names should be spelled the way they are pronounced. Individuals Streets named after individuals shall be a posthumously honour and Council shall consider such names provided that a written consent is obtained from the individual’s surviving immediate family. A written description is required detailing how the individual made a significant contribution to the Municipality of Meaford. The honouring of a living public figure requires his/her written consent. Two Word Street Names Proposed street names consisting of two words shall be changed to one word. Only a person’s last name shall be used unless additional identification is necessitated by the Municipality to prevent duplication with an existing street name in the municipality and surrounding local municipalities. Street Name Characteristics Names should generally not exceed ten characters in length. This helps ensure that the above mentioned criterion are met and that there is a standard street name signage across the municipality and county. Street Names to Avoid 1. Names that are in conflict with other street names within the Municipality or County of Grey. 2. Names that could be construed as advertising a particular business, product or brand. 3. Cumbersome, corrupted, modified names, discriminatory or derogatory names from the point of view of race, sex, colour, creed, political affiliation or other social factors. 4. Names with any sexual overtones, inappropriate humour, parody, slang or double meaning. 5. Names that have a secondary negative or offensive connotation. 6. Street names spelled differently but sound alike (i.e. Crosby Lane and Crosbie Lane) or have similar pronunciation but are spelled differently (i.e. Heirloom Street could be pronounced with ‘H’ dropped (Eirloom Street)). 7. Use of complex words (ex. Quetico Drive). 8. Names with hyphens, apostrophes or dashes are discouraged and only considered on a case by case basis provided other criterion is met.",Has an approved names list however there is nothing on it,mwiltonsiegel@meaford.ca,44.591111,-80.743333

quebec_boisbriand,,record,Boisbriand,Quebec,Yes,"Le premier rôle de la toponymie est de permettre le repérage géographique rapide et sécuritaire d’un lieu donné. C’est pourquoi l’attribution de noms aux lieux est encadré par des règles bien établies. Le second rôle de la toponymie est d’exprimer par des noms certains aspects de notre culture. À ce titre, la toponymie fait partie du patrimoine collectif. Le toponyme traduit une reconnaissance publique d’une cause, de la mémoire d’un personnage ou d’un événement. Ainsi, le toponyme anime le lieu et cristallise le sentiment d’appartenance à la collectivité. <br><br>Formuler des avis toponymiques  Obtenir tous les renseignements pertinents permettant une analyse et une décision éclairées;  Analyser, à la lumière des informations recueillies, toutes les demandes toponymiques qui lui sont soumises;  Formuler des avis toponymiques au conseil municipal lorsque requis. Le Comité de la toponymie et du patrimoine a un pouvoir de recommandation en ce qui a trait à l’attribution de noms;  Recommander au conseil municipal le nom de tous les nouveaux sites publics construits par la Ville, incluant rues, parcs, bâtiments, etc. Coordonner la gestion et la bonification de la banque de noms disponibles  Verser les appellations retenues dans la banque de noms disponibles et refuser les noms qui ne sont pas admissibles;  Coordonner les actions, recherches et ressources nécessaires à la bonification de la banque;  Suggérer des toponymes et/ou des thématiques lors de développement de nouvelles zones, lorsque requis;  Consulter la population, sur recommandation, afin d’obtenir des suggestions de toponymes et de connaître les préférences des citoyens. Assurer le bon fonctionnement du Comité  Tenir à jour toute la documentation justifiant les décisions du Comité. <br><br>Dépôt d’une requête  Toute personne qui dépose au Comité de la toponymie et du patrimoine une requête de dénomination doit remplir le formulaire de proposition toponymique (accessible en ligne ou à l’hôtel de ville). Le requérant a la responsabilité de procurer aux membres du Comité toute l’information relative au nom proposé et qui est nécessaire à l’analyse de sa demande.  Le Comité se réserve le droit de refuser ou de traiter toute demande pour laquelle un formulaire n’a pas été rempli ou dont le formulaire ne fournit pas suffisamment de renseignements.  Après le dépôt d’une requête, un accusé de réception est envoyé au requérant pour l’informer que sa demande sera traitée dans les meilleurs délais lors de la prochaine rencontre du Comité. Préparation du dossier  Un dossier est ouvert par le Comité pour chaque demande soumise.  Le Comité compile le plus de renseignements possible à propos du nom proposé. Ces renseignements serviront à l’analyse de la proposition. Analyse de la requête  L’analyse de la proposition toponymique est effectuée par les membres du Comité . À la suite de l’exercice, un rapport d’analyse est rédigé, puis versé au dossier de la demande.  Cette étape du processus de dénomination a pour but d’évaluer la valeur toponymiq <br><br>Critères d’analyse Dans son analyse, le Comité accorde une attention particulière aux critères suivants :  Conformité aux critères de choix de la Ville de Boisbriand (voir Annexe 1 – Extrait du Guide toponymique municipal de la Commission de toponymie du Québec) Le nom proposé est conforme aux critères de choix élaborés par la Ville selon les normes de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. En cas de conflit entre les critères de la Ville et ceux de la Commission, les critères de la Commission ont préséance.  Ancienneté du nom Le nom proposé a un caractère historique ou patrimonial; il fait notamment référence à une personne ou à un événement de notre histoire.  Caractère logique de la désignation Il existe un lien pertinent entre le nom proposé et le lieu à nommer dans le respect des thématiques existantes, s’il y a lieu. Dans les cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronçons devront porter le nom des tronçons existants.  Désignation commémorative Le nom proposé est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment d’appartenance à la ville. Il met en valeur l’identité boisbriannaise, les lieux d’appartenance, la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que le caractère francophone de la ville.  Doublon et homonyme Le nom proposé n’est ni un doublon ni un homonyme d’un lieu existant; aucune redondance ni aucun risque de confusion ne seront ainsi engendrés par celuici. <br><br>Unicité du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou toute entité géographique se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel. De la même façon, la Commission de toponymie du Québec officialise un seul nom pour une voie de communication ou pour chacun des tronçons de celle-ci afin d’éviter qu’une voie sans interruption soit composée de plusieurs tronçons ayant chacun leur propre nom. Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage est déjà établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils satisfont à tous les critères. Dans les cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. Exemple : chemin des Érables Langue de l’élément spécifique Les noms communs qui entrent dans la composition de nouveaux toponymes sont en français. Exemple : chemin des Érables Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots d’une autre langue que le français qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Exemple : chemin Maple Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visés par cette règle et sont écrits dans leur forme originale. Exemple : chemin Queen-Mary Présence et unicité du générique Le nom d’une voie de communication, d’un parc public, d’un édifice ou d’une autre construction comporte toujours un générique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction de générique. Utilisation de génériques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques. Ces génériques sont répertoriés sur le site web de la Commission de toponymie du Québec dans la section Normes et procédures – Terminologie géographique. Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques. Par exemple, le nom officiel Lac du Clocher est repris de façon intégrale dans le nom chemin du Lac-du-Clocher",Application form added to OneDrive folder,mfgagne@ville.boisbriand.qc.ca,45.612222,-73.839167

Cette proposition doit être expliquée et une justification doit être donnée sur la raison pour laquelle aucune proposition de la liste n’a été retenue. 3 Cette liste aura été préalablement soumise au comité pour recommandation au conseil. Cette liste est revue à une fréquence suffisante pour assurer une diversité de propositions. <br><br>Suite à la signature d’un protocole d’entente relatif à des travaux municipaux comprenant une nouvelle rue ou à l’acceptation d’un plan image comprenant une allée d’accès ou suite à l’aménagement d’un nouveau lieu qui requière d’être nommé, le conseil nomme cette rue, cette allée d’accès ou ce lieu. Le propriétaire de cette rue, de cette allée d’accès ou de ce lieu est consulté pour trouver un nom à l’entité à nommer. S’il ne soumet aucune proposition au fonctionnaire dans un délai de 30 jours de la signature du protocole d’entente, de l’acceptation du plan image dans le cas d’une allée d’accès ou de l’aménagement du nouveau lieu, le conseil procède au choix du nom, sans plus amples délais. <br><br>Lorsque la rue, l’allée d’accès ou le lieu est déjà existant, le conseil conserve le nom déjà existant ou le modifie après avoir consulté le requérant de cette nouvelle dénomination et son propriétaire. La procédure est enclenchée par la soumission d’une proposition de modification de nom par un requérant. Cette proposition est transmise au propriétaire de cette entité qui a 30 jours pour l’accepter, soumettre une nouvelle proposition ou demander de conserver le nom déjà existant. À l’échéance de ce délai, le conseil décide de conserver le nom existant ou procède au choix d’un nouveau nom, sans plus amples délais. <br><br>Les propositions doivent être faites par écrit et doivent être soumises au fonctionnaire. Dans le cas où le nom d’une personne est considéré, le fonctionnaire contacte un représentant de cette famille, lorsqu’il y en a un qui demeure dans la ville et qu’il est possible de le faire afin de recevoir l’aval de cette dernière. La famille pourra prendre 15 jours pour signifier sa position, par écrit. À la réception de la position de la famille ou à l’échéance du délai de 15 jours, s’il y a lieu, le conseil nomme l’entité à nommer. <br><br>Les critères de décision pour nommer une rue, une allée ou un lieu sont : - le respect de la présente politique; - lorsque le nom d’une personne est considéré pour nommer une rue, une allée ou un lieu et qu’il est approprié de le faire, le prénom doit être ajouté; - ne pas se restreindre à l’emplacement physique de la rue, de l’allée ou du lieu pour promouvoir le patrimoine d’un secteur donné; - autant que possible, la proposition soumise ne doit pas être longue. <br><br>Le nom choisi doit être conforme aux critères de choix et aux règles d’écriture établis par la Commission de toponymie du Québec qui approuve et officialise les toponymes et les odonymes. <br><br>Exceptionnellement, une proposition qui ne respecte pas les dispositions de la présente politique pourra être considérée.

Par contre, s’il est possible, il faut également considérer la présente politique (exemple : choisir un peintre ayant un lien avec la ville pour le secteur comportant des noms de peintre); - lorsque le nom est temporaire. Par exemple, lorsque la rue est vouée à être prolongée à moyen terme pour rejoindre une autre rue déjà nommée. - lorsque, de l’avis du conseil, une circonstance particulière fait en sorte que la présente politique ne peut être respectée intégralement.

La désignation d’un nom aux parcs et espaces verts municipaux doit rencontrer l’un ou plusieurs des objectifs suivants : 1 o favoriser un nom reflétant les caractéristiques du milieu naturel environnant; 2 o favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement de la ville; 3 o favoriser le nom de la rue adjacente au parc pour permettre un meilleur repérage de celui-ci par les usagers.",N/A,toponymie@longueuil.quebec,45.533333,-73.516667

quebec_rouyn-noranda,,record,Rouyn-Noranda,Quebec,Yes,"4. PROCÉDURE POUR PROPOSER UN TOPONYME Toute personne morale ou physique peut soumettre à la Ville de Rouyn-Noranda une proposition de toponyme en soumettant sa proposition à l’aide du formulaire en ligne prévu à cet effet. Le dépôt d’une requête est suivi par l’envoi d’un accusé de réception indiquant au requérant que sa demande sera traitée dans les meilleurs délais lors de la prochaine rencontre du comité patrimoine et toponymie. Toute proposition de dénomination reçue par la Ville est ensuite acheminée au comité. Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne, le comité s’informe auprès de la famille ou des proches pour obtenir plus de détails tout en mentionnant à ces derniers qu’une analyse sera faite. À la suite de l’analyse de la proposition, le comité patrimoine et toponymie peut rejeter une appellation proposée, selon les critères établis. Une lettre expliquant les motifs du refus sera alors acheminée au requérant et le dossier sera fermé. Le conseil municipal sera informé par le biais des comptes rendus des travaux du comité. Dans le cas où une proposition est retenue par le comité patrimoine et toponymie, la Ville verra à obtenir un avis technique de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. Une fois l’avis technique obtenu, le comité transmet sa recommandation au conseil municipal. Dans le cas d’une décision favorable par le conseil municipal, le comité informera la famille de la personne honorée, le cas échéant, et le requérant. Le toponyme sera alors soit versé dans la banque de noms disponibles ou adopté par résolution par le conseil municipal pour désigner un lieu. Une fois la résolution adoptée, celle-ci est transmise à la Commission de toponymie du Québec, qui officialise la nomination. Celle-ci entre en vigueur lors de la réception d’une réponse d’officialisation de la Commission de toponymie du Québec. La Ville achemine alors l’information aux services concernés (urbanisme, évaluation, travaux publics, communications, sécurité civile, Postes Canada, etc.). Dans le cas où un toponyme n’est pas approuvé par le conseil municipal, celui-ci devra retourner le dossier au comité patrimoine et toponymie en mentionnant les raisons pour lesquelles ce nom n’a pas été retenu. Le toponyme pourra alors, selon le cas, être conservé dans la banque de noms, avec une mention du refus. <br><br>5. RÈGLES DE DÉNOMINATION 5.1. Principes directeurs Voici les principes et critères qui sont pris en compte dans l’analyse des propositions déposées : <br>• Souligner le caractère unique du territoire de Rouyn-Noranda et de son histoire. <br>• Afin de favoriser un équilibre, prioriser des noms qui correspondent à une toponymie féminine, autochtone et de la diversité culturelle. Dans le cas de la toponymie autochtone, une attention particulière doit être accordée pour être étudiée de concert avec les communautés concernées. 8 <br>• Tenir compte de la nature du lieu, de son utilisation et de l’histoire du secteur géographique (le bon nom au bon endroit); <br>• Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne, tenir compte de son lien avec le lieu choisi. <br>• Favoriser les noms complets des personnes (prénom et nom); <br>• Lorsqu’il s’agit d’un nom commun, tenir compte des éléments géographiques et topographiques à proximité du lieu ou privilégier les noms pouvant servir à repérer plus facilement l’endroit. <br>• Pour les parcs, favoriser un nom reflétant les caractéristiques du milieu naturel environnant, le nom de la rue adjacente (ou du quartier) pour un meilleur repérage ou le nom d’une personne en lien avec le secteur. <br>• Pour les édifices publics, favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement local, régional ou national. <br>• Lorsqu’un nouveau développement résidentiel se présente, privilégier un thème commun pour la désignation des nouvelles rues, sans toutefois l’exiger. <br>• Éviter l'emploi de noms à connotation péjorative ou grossière, de même que les choix susceptibles de provoquer ou d'alimenter une dissension ou controverse. <br>• Ne pas retenir comme toponyme le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. <br>• Éviter les noms à consonance semblable (homonyme) ou doublons qui pourraient confondre le repérage par les services d’urgence. <br>• Respecter les règles d’écritures établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec. <br>• Ne pas faire disparaître un toponyme en le remplaçant par un autre. Par contre, advenant qu’un toponyme soit jugé largement controversé, un changement pourrait alors être envisagé. <br> <br><br>5.2. Types de désignations Il existe différents types de désignations : <br>• Honorifique : Pour évoquer la mémoire de personnes qui se sont distinguées au sein de la communauté de Rouyn-Noranda dans les domaines artistique, communautaire, économique, éducatif, religieux, scientifique, social, sportif, etc. <br>• Historique : Pour évoquer la mémoire de personnages de l’histoire locale comme des pionniers et pionnières, des vieilles et grandes familles d’un quartier, un évènement marquant, etc. 9 <br>• Géographique : Pour évoquer des traits géographiques ou faisant appel aux traits caractéristiques d’un lieu. <br>• Thématique : Celle-ci est utilisée lorsque plusieurs emplacements à nommer sont regroupés dans un même développement urbain ou rural. Dans ce cas, il est possible d’évoquer des noms de personnalité et des noms communs en lien avec la thématique retenue.",Form A Honorary or Historical Designation: https://formulaires.rouyn-noranda.ca/proposition-de-toponymie-formulaire-a-honorifique-ou-historique/ <br><br>Form B Significant Event Designation: https://formulaires.rouyn-noranda.ca/proposition-de-toponymie-formulaire-b-evenement-marquant/ <br><br>Form C Geographical or Thematic Designation: https://formulaires.rouyn-noranda.ca/proposition-de-toponymie-formulaire-c-geographique-ou-thematique/,info@rouyn-noranda.ca,48.239167,-79.016389

quebec_saint-bruno-de-montarville,,record,Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville,Quebec,Yes,"1.1 Contexte Au Québec, la Commission de toponymie a le mandat d’effectuer l’inventaire, la normalisation, l’officialisation et la diffusion des noms de lieux. Les municipalités sont cependant responsables du choix de leurs noms de voies de communication, ou odonymes, ainsi que de celui des noms de parcs publics, d’édifices et d’autres constructions qui leur appartiennent. La Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville accueillera au cours des prochaines années, des projets nécessitant l’aménagement de nouvelles rues. La présente politique de dénomination toponymique est un outil pour orienter les choix de toponymes pour le conseil local de patrimoine et de toponymie et le conseil municipal. Elle édicte des lignes directrices en matière de toponymie garantissant, par le fait même, une qualité odonymique sur son territoire. La politique permet à la Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville de gérer efficacement l’ensemble des dossiers toponymiques et d’améliorer la méthodologie en matière de dénomination. 1.2 Objectifs La politique de dénomination toponymique vise à : - Mettre en valeur les particularités et les spécificités locales propres à chaque secteur du territoire de la Ville; - Mettre en valeur l’histoire et le patrimoine de la Ville par la dénomination de ses rues, ses chemins, ses lieux et ses bâtiments; - Développer un sentiment d’appartenance des citoyens par la dénomination; - Établir une démarche claire et respectueuse pour procéder à la dénomination toponymique des lieux. 1.3 Champs d’application La présente politique s’applique à toutes requêtes de dénomination toponymique, peu importe la nature et la provenance. Elle inclut celles initiées par les diverses instances de la Ville. Le conseil local du patrimoine et de toponymie doit exercer sa mission sur le territoire de la Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. Les lieux et les espaces à désigner sont : - Les voies de communication (rues, chemins, etc.); - Les parcs et espaces verts publics; - Les édifices et salles publiques à l’intérieur des édifices; - Les équipements sportifs ou culturels publics; - Tous les autres lieux ou espaces d’intérêt public. <br><br>4. PROCÉDURES 4.1 Dépôt d’une demande de dénomination toponymique Tout citoyen, groupe de personnes ou organisme qui dépose une demande de dénomination toponymique doit remplir le formulaire prévu à cet effet et le déposer à la Direction de l’urbanisme, de l’environnement et du développement durable. Le requérant a la responsabilité de fournir toutes les informations relatives au toponyme proposé nécessaires à l’analyse de sa demande, expliquer l’essence du toponyme proposé et les raisons pour lesquelles il devrait être officialisé. <br><br>5. RÈGLES DE DÉNOMINATION 5.1 Critères d’analyse dictés par la Ville - Relation entre le nom et le lieu qu’il désigne - Favoriser les noms ayant un lien logique, étroit et d’intérêt avec le lieu; - Tenir compte de la nature et de l’usage du lieu (voie, parc, place publique, immeuble, contexte résidentiel, commercial, industriel ou culturel, etc.); - Tenir compte des caractéristiques géographiques naturelles du lieu (faune, flore, géologie, etc.); - Tenir compte de l’histoire du quartier en termes urbain (usages actuels ou passés) et social (pionniers, longévité familiale sur les lieux, anecdotes); - Tenir compte des traditions du milieu local ou régional (surnom du lieu). - Originalité, valeur poétique et euphonie (harmonie des sons) - Favoriser les noms inspirant des images fortes; - Préserver les régionalismes; - Éviter les toponymes banals et utilisés fréquemment; - Éviter les toponymes servant de désignation publicitaire; - Éviter les noms dont l’attribution pourrait provoquer la controverse. - Sentiment d’appartenance - Favoriser les noms mettant en valeur l’identité montarvilloise, les lieux d’appartenance et le caractère du milieu dans lequel il s’inscrit. - Mise en valeur du patrimoine culturel - Favoriser les noms issus de l’histoire et du patrimoine local, régional ou national (référence à une personne, un fait ou un événement); - Honorer une seule fois une même personne ou chose. - Point de repère - Tenir compte de la toponymie existante; - Favoriser les noms permettant de se repérer plus facilement; - Éviter les homonymes et les doublons. - Lorsqu’il s’agit du nom d’une personne : - Favoriser le nom de personnes ayant contribué de façon significative au développement, au dynamisme ou au bien-être de la communauté; - Privilégier le nom sous lequel la personne est la mieux connue (nom complet, titre accompagné du nom complet, pseudonyme, etc.); - Retenir le nom complet de la personne (prénom et nom de famille); - Recourir au nom de famille seul pour honorer une famille complète. <br><br>5.2 Critères de choix prescrits par la Commission Le nom doit respecter les règles d’écriture et être conforme aux critères de choix de la Commission. - Unicité du nom de lieu Tout lieu ou entité géographique se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel. - Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils ne dérogent pas à d’autres critères. Dans les cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. - Langue de l’élément générique L’élément générique est en français. Exemple : Chemin De La Rabastalière Ouest - Langue de l’élément spécifique Les noms communs composant de nouveaux toponymes sont en français. Exemple : Chemin De La Rabastalière Ouest Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots d’une autre langue que le français qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Exemple : Chemin Maple Les noms propres qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes (noms de famille, noms de lieux, etc.) ne sont pas visés par cette règle et sont écrits dans leur forme originale. Exemple : Place Stephen-Leacock - Présence et unicité du générique Le nom d’une voie de communication, d’un parc public, d’un édifice ou d’une autre construction comporte toujours un générique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction de générique. - Utilisation de génériques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de l’Office québécois de la langue française). - Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un an. - Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel est utilisé pour composer un autre toponyme, il doit en respecter la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques. Exemple : Le nom officiel « Lac Seigneurial » est repris de façon intégrale dans le nom « Chemin du Lac-Seigneurial ». 5.3 Particularités Lorsqu’une rue est prolongée, c’est-à-dire qu’elle n’est pas sectionnée par une intersection, il est préférable de garder le même odonyme. Si le prolongement rejoint une autre rue existante avec un nom différent, l’odonyme choisi doit être le même que l’une des rues qu’il rejoint.",N/A,information@stbruno.ca,45.526007,-73.340591

ontario_cobourg,,record,Cobourg,Ontario,Yes,"OBJECTIVES 2.1 The Town of Cobourg shall have the authority to name any municipally owned property and the name shall be based upon a criteria established by this policy. The main objectives of this policy shall include: <br>• To continue the current practice of naming municipal property, buildings and parks after significant geographical, neighbourhood and historical elements. <br>• To recognize, on an exceptional basis, significant contributions that organizations or individuals have made to public life and the well-being of the residents of Cobourg. <br>• To provide direction on how to apply for approval to name, rename or dedicate a municipal street, park, or facility. <br>• To ensure the application of a defined consultation process to encourage community/public participation through public engagement. <br>• ensure proper approval process and the importance of the role of Municipal Council and Advisory Committee's approval and support; <br>• ensure a clear, efficient and timely naming process; <br>• ensure the application of key criteria to determine the validity of a name; <br>• ensure that all municipal streets, municipally-owned parks and facilities are easily identifiable; <br>• ensure that the given names of municipal streets, municipally-owned parks and facilities are consistent with the values and character of the area or neighbourhood served; <br>• encourage the dedication of lands, facilities or donations by individuals, business, developers and/or groups. 3. NAMING PRINCIPLES 3.1 When a municipal street, facility, or park is named, renamed or dedicated, the following principles shall be applied when a name is being considered: <br>• names should give a sense of place, continuity, belonging and celebrate the distinguishing characteristics and uniqueness of the Town of Cobourg; <br>• names should promote civic pride in the Town of Cobourg, acknowledge local cultural heritage, history and recognize unique features and geography (such as names that relate to local history, places, and events, native wildlife and natural features or unique characteristics of a neighbourhood or area.) <br>• the rationale associated with the use of particular names shall be understandable to the majority of Town of Cobourg residents. <br>• names may recognize the contributions of organizations such as a partnerships with or without financial contributions. 3.2 Priority shall be given to naming, renaming or dedicating a municipal street, facility, or park after: <br>• the area or street in which the property or building is located to provide a geographical association to help the public to locate a park, bridge, neighbourhood or building more easily; <br>• an historical name related to the Town of Cobourg's cultural heritage and/or history; <br>• an organization or individual to recognize particular activities and significant contributions to the community, and/or outstanding contributions and/or sponsorships made toward the development and/or enhancement of a property or building. 4. PROCESSES 4.1 The naming of municipal parks, streets, and facilities and other municipal assets may involve a different process which will depend on the circumstances surrounding the request/requirement for naming. A. Naming a Municipal Street <br>• The process for naming of new municipal streets shall occur as part of the final subdivision/development approval process and prior to the Town of Cobourg acquiring title to the lands as a road allowance. The process for re-naming an existing municipal street shall begin once the Town of Cobourg has received a written request which includes the background and rationale for considering the street name change, as per the criteria established by this policy. The Cobourg Planning Department receives a written request by the proponent or developer for a name(s) which includes the proposed municipal street name(s) and an explanation of the significance of the name. In the absence of a submission for consideration of a name by the developer or proponent, Planning Department staff will provide the Coordinator of Planning and Development Services with the names available for use as recommended by municipal staff for the specific municipal street(s). The proposed street name(s) will then be included in the Planning Departments report to Council as part of the subdivision/development final approval process or municipal street re-naming process as the case may be. <br>• Conditions of property donation and/or property improvements or development as agreed upon by the donor/developer and the Town shall be honoured regarding the naming of the municipal street(s) subject to this policy and final approval by Council resolution. <br>• Processing of an application for a municipal street name request involves confirmation criteria including; submission of relevant background justification by the developer or proponent, discussion with the developer or proponent, discussion with and review by Cobourg municipal staff, including emergency services, and the Cobourg Heritage Advisory Committee where deemed necessary (within the Heritage Districts), and consultation with the Council Coordinator of Planning and Development Services. The Planning Department shall inform the developer or the proponent if the name is known to conflict with existing street names or is otherwise unacceptable to any of the parties consulted and shall provide a reason why the name is not acceptable. Commemorative municipal street name(s) shall be the responsibility of the Planning Department and the Town of Cobourg. Where a request for a commemorative street name has been made, the name shall be evaluated through the criteria and evaluation process of this policy and the processing may include consultation with additional stakeholders as deemed necessary. B. Naming of a Municipal Park or Facility <br>• The process for naming of municipal parks or facilities should begin when the Town of Cobourg acquires titles to lands or within twelve (12) months after the Town has acquired titles to lands and once the lands have developed into a park or facility. <br>• Proposed park and facility names are either: 1. Specific to a particular park or facility site (as in the case of the development of a new park or the renaming of an existing park); or 2. Generic park or facility names not related to a specific site. <br>• Where proposed names are site specific, staff shall undertake to weigh the significance of the proposed name against the policy guidelines for park or facility naming, as well as against those names contained in the parks name listing as maintained by the Recreation and Culture Division. <br>• All requests for naming municipal parks or facilities are to be submitted in writing and by completing the Naming Application Form as attached to this policy as Schedule ""A"" to Cobourg Recreation and Culture Division and providing sufficient information as to how the proposed name satisfies the criteria pursuant to the policy. Adequate historical or descriptive information shall be provided to validate the proposed name, in order for Recreation and Culture Division Staff to have a clear understanding and appreciation for the request. In the absence of a submission for consideration of a name for a municipal park or facility, Recreation and Culture Division Staff will provide the Coordinator of Parks and Recreation Services the names as recommended by Municipal Staff for the specific park or facility. <br>• Where proposed names are site specific, staff shall undertake to weigh the significance of the proposed name against the policy guidelines for municipal park or facility naming, as well as against those considered in the parks name listing inventory as maintained and updated by the Recreation and Culture Division. <br>• Processing the application involves confirmation of criteria, discussion with the applicable town departments/external stakeholders, including emergency services, and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee in consultation with the Coordinator of Parks and Recreation Services. <br>• Each application/nomination will be reviewed and evaluated initially by Cobourg Recreation and Culture Division Staff, and each application/nomination that meets the policy requirements will be submitted to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee for review. <br>• The Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee shall review all applications and nominations for municipal park or facility names as forwarded by the Recreation and Culture Division. The Committee shall recommend a name to be forwarded to Council for approval by a committee motion based on the criteria as outlined within this policy. <br>• When a name is recommended for approval, a report shall be drafted by municipal the Recreation and Culture Division Staff outlining the process that was conducted and the applications received containing the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee recommendation for the municipal park or facility name. <br>• Once the recommendation is submitted, Council may approve the name through a formal resolution which will confirm the official naming of a municipal park or facility within the Town of Cobourg. The applicant that submitted the official nomination for the name will be notified of Council's decision. 5. COMMEMORATIVE NAMING 5.1 Where the commemorative naming of a municipal street, facility, or park, is being requested, only one of the following criteria shall apply: <br>• the nominated individual shall have demonstrated excellence, courage or exceptional service to the citizens of the Town of Cobourg, the Province of Ontario, and/or Canada, including past Mayor's and veterans of military conflicts; <br>• a direct relationship or association that existed between the place of residence and the community efforts undertaken by an individual and the property, building or element to be named; <br>• an individual may be recognized for a significant financial contribution to a park or facility, where that contribution significantly benefits the community that the park or facility serves, in accordance with the Municipal Sponsorship Policy. 5.2 Where the name of an individual/organization is used, approval shall be obtained from the individual (his/her family) or the organization for such naming. 5.3 The names of municipal parks, streets, and facilities, as well as major elements of such municipal assets named commemoratively should not be changed unless it is found that the individual's personal character is or was such that the continuous use of their name for a park, street, or facility would not be in the best interest of the community. 5.4 The following criteria shall be used in determining the appropriateness of the municipal street naming designation: a) Person who served as a Mayor in the Town of Cobourg; b) Fallen World War 1, World War 2 and Boer War veterans (as endorsed by the Cobourg Legion); c) Fallen Canadian Armed Forces Service Personnel; d) A person, developer, group, or feature particularly identified with the land or a nearby facility; and e) Local names of cultural or historical significance, to the community (as endorsed by the Cobourg Heritage Committee). 6.

Elle s’applique également à toute démarche visant la dénomination des entités géographiques et administratives. Le territoire pour lequel le comité de toponymie doit exercer sa mission est celui de la Municipalité de Sainte-Martine. Les lieux et espaces à désigner sont : Les voies de circulations (rues, les chemins, etc.) ; Les parcs et espaces verts, Les édifices publics et les salles publiques à l’intérieur de ces édifices, Tous les autres lieux ou espaces publics <br><br>5.1 Procédure: <br><br>Dépôt d’une demande de dénomination toponymique Tout citoyen, groupe de personnes ou organisme qui dépose une demande de dénomination toponymique doit remplir le formulaire prévu à cet effet et le déposer au Service de l’urbanisme. Le requérant a la responsabilité de fournir toutes les informations relatives au toponyme proposé nécessaires à l’analyse de sa demande. Une demande sera considérée comme recevable par le Service de l’urbanisme si les documents requis ont été transmis, et ce, au plus tard dans les 60 jours suivant l’ouverture du dossier et si ladite demande répond aux critères d’analyse établis dans la présente Politique. Le requérant sera avisé par écrit dans le cas où sa demande est irrecevable. <br><br>Préparation du dossier Le Service de l’urbanisme ouvre le dossier de dénomination toponymique et transmet un accusé de réception au requérant. Le Service de l’urbanisme prépare le dossier de la demande de dénomination toponymique en vue de sa présentation au comité de toponymie en procédant notamment aux étapes suivantes : <br>• Analyse de la recevabilité de la demande; <br>• Recherche et compilation d’informations complémentaires à la demande; <br>• Demande d’assistance auprès d’autres services municipaux, le cas échéant; <br>• Préparation d’un rapport pour la présen- tation de la demande à la séance du comité de toponymie; <br>• Transmission du rapport accompagné de tous les documents pertinents au comité de toponymie. <br><br>Analyse et recommandation du comité de toponymie Le comité de toponymie analyse la demande de dénomination toponymique soumise en fonction des critères d’analyse et de choix des noms des lieux établis dans la présente Politique et formule une recommandation par écrit au conseil municipal. <br><br>Critères d’analyse et de choix des noms de lieux: <br><br>Générique Le nom d’une voie de communication, d’un parc public, d’un édifice ou d’une autre construction comporte toujours un générique. Il ne peut cependant inclure plus d’un terme exerçant la fonction de générique. <br><br>Utilisation d’un nom déjà officiel Lorsqu’on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l’élément spécifique d’un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte la forme, moyennant l’ajout de majuscules et de traits d’union en fonction des règles d’écriture toponymiques. Exemple : le nom officiel rivière des Fèves est repris de façon intégrale dans le nom chemin de la Rivière-des-Fèves Nord. <br><br>Doublon et homonyme Tout lieu se voit attribuer un seul nom officiel. Deux lieux ne devraient pas porter le même nom ni un nom semblable, dans le but d’éviter la redondance et le risque de confusion engendrés par l’existence de doublons et d’homonymes. <br><br>Ambiguïté Toute ambiguïté dans la dénomination doit être évitée afin d’assurer la sécurité reliée à la recherche d’une adresse civique pour divers services (ambulancier, policier, incendie, etc.). <br><br>Langue de l’élément générique Les noms communs qui entrent dans la composition de nouveaux toponymes sont en français. Exemple: Chemin de la Haute-Rivière <br><br>Langue de l’élément spécifique Il est possible de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots d’une autre langue que le français qu’un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. Exemple: Rue Logan <br><br>Utilisation de génériques conformes Les nouveaux noms de voies de communication doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques (avis de l’Office québécois de la langue française). <br><br>Usage Les toponymes dont l’usage populaire est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s’ils ne dérogent pas à d’autres critères. Dans le cas d’usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. Le nom d’une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d’un (1) an ne doit pas être attribué à une voie de communication, mais pourrait exceptionnellement l’être à tout autre lieu. Le nom proposé rend hommage à une personnalité qui a apporté une contribution significative au développement, au dynamisme ou au bien-être de la communauté, de la municipalité ou ailleurs. <br><br>Noms portant à controverse Le choix d’un nom dont l’attribution pourrait provoquer une controverse doit être évité. <br><br>Remplacement d’un nom par un autre Le choix d’un nom dont l’attribution pourrait provoquer une controverse doit être évité. <br><br>Caractère logique de la désignation Il existe un lien pertinent entre le toponyme proposé et le lieu à nommer en tenant notamment compte des thématiques établies sur le plan du système des noms de rue. Dans le cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronçons devraient autant que possible porter le nom des tronçons existants. <br><br>Sentiment d’appartenance Le nom proposé est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment d’appartenance à la municipalité. Il met en valeur l’identité des citoyens de SainteMartine, le patrimoine autochtone, la diversité culturelle de la population, les lieux d’appartenance, ainsi que le caractère francophone de la municipalité. <br><br>Représentativité des femmes Le nom proposé vise à améliorer la représentativité des femmes, en tenant notamment compte de l’importance et de la superficie du lieu nommé, et n’est pas nécessairement lié à l’histoire de Sainte-Martine, bien que ce soit privilégié <br><br>Représentativité des communautés culturelles Le nom proposé permet d’augmenter la représentativité des communautés culturelles et n’est pas nécessairement lié à l’histoire de Sainte-Martine, bien que ce soit privilégié. <br><br>Voies publiques de communication La dénomination des voies de communication (odonyme) tient notamment compte des thématiques établies sur le plan du système des noms de rue. <br><br>Règles d’écriture Les règles d’écriture établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec doivent être respectées.",Naming application form in OneDrive,urbanisme@sainte-martine.ca,45.25,-73.8

quebec_levis,,record,Lévis,Quebec,Yes,"La toponymie <br>• La toponymie relève de plusieurs dimensions: ➢L’identité ➢La localisation et la sécurité ➢La commémoration et la mémoire ➢Impact durable et à long terme <br>• La toponymie revêt un caractère subjectif et discrétionnaire qui ont un impact durable pour les citoyens, les entreprises, les services publics, les services d’urgence et un grand nombre d’organisations. « Les noms de rues dans une ville ont plus d'importance qu'on le croit généralement. À ceux qui ne veulent pas ou qui n'ont pas le temps de lire, ils sont une leçon d'histoire qu'ils apprennent d'autant plus facilement qu'elle est toujours sous leurs yeux ». <br><br>Processus d’attribution <br>• Des toponymes sont attribués: ➢Lors de l’ouverture de nouvelles rues; ➢Lors de la planification de nouveaux développements; ➢Lors de la création d’un nouveau parc ou espace vert; ➢Lors d’un processus de correction ou d’harmonisation; ➢Exceptionnellement, lors d’un processus de commémoration. <br>• Habituellement, lors d’un processus de commémoration, la demande est déposée par la famille, des amis, une organisation ou un groupe de personnes ou initié par la Ville. <br><br>Principes d’attribution des noms de lieux Principe 1 : Un nom doit être pleinement significatif en fonction du lieu où il est attribué. Principe 2 : Les propositions de noms de lieux et d’autres entités publiques reposent sur les sujets suivants : ➢ Rappel de l’histoire locale ; ➢ Rendre hommage aux femmes et aux hommes qui ont réalisé des actions significatives dans leur communauté ; ➢ Faire référence à la géographie, la topographie, phénomènes biophysiques ou autres éléments naturels de l’environnement immédiat de la voie. Par exemple : rue du Cran, rue des Ravines, rue de l’Affluent, rue de l’Étale ; ➢ Développer le sentiment de fierté et d’attachement pour son quartier et son environnement; ➢ Évoquer des éléments disparus significatifs localement. Par exemple, rue de la Briqueterie, rue du Manoir, rue Longwood; ➢ Rappel des activités traditionnelles et des usages des appellations populaires ; ➢ Simplicité et facilité de l’usage du nom ; ➢ Poursuite des thématiques existantes ou création d’une nouvelle thématique. <br><br>Principe 3 : La sécurité et la localisation doivent toujours être considérées pour l’attribution d’un nom. Ainsi, dans un quartier donné, on évitera la multiplication de noms composés ou un nom dont la prononciation peut être difficile. Principe 4 : S’assurer de la cohésion du nom attribué à long terme. On évite ainsi l’attribution de noms ou d’expressions à un lieu qui peut changer de vocation. Par exemple : rue Commerciale, rue Industrielle, rue Principale, etc. Principe 5 : Le travail en toponymie tente d’être le plus cohérent possible avec des orientations d’organismes sur le territoire. Par exemple, la commission consultative Femmes et ville pour la valorisation des noms de femmes dans la toponymie. <br><br>Principe 6 : Éviter la répétition de noms (doublons) ou les homophones (chemin du Sault vs rue Dussault). Principe 7 : Éviter toute commémoration spontanée ou hâtive. Selon la Commission de toponymie du Québec, une période d’un an doit être respectée à la suite du décès d’une personne avant que son nom soit attribué à une entité. L’accord et l’appui de la famille est important pour l’attribution du nom d’une personne à une entité. Le nom d’une personne doit être attribué à un lieu ainsi qu’à un moment qui est jugé significatif. Principe 8 : La toponymie devrait représenter l’ensemble de la communauté lévisienne. En ce sens, les personnes honorées devraient représenter la diversité des domaines de la société qui la compose. Par exemple : l’engagement communautaire, le bénévolat, figures historiques, personnalités sportives, etc. <br><br>Principe 9 : L’usage d’un toponyme dont la prononciation peut porter à confusion ou à d’autres interprétations est à éviter. Par exemple, on évitera l’usage d’un nom à double sens. Principe 10 : Tout toponyme doit respecter les règles d’écriture établies par la Commission de toponymie du Québec. <br><br>La ville de Lévis est composée d’une multitude d’éléments qui possèdent chacun leur identité propre. On a qu’à penser aux noms de rues, aux arrondissements, aux édifices publics, etc. Que ce soit dans un communiqué de presse, une résolution du conseil de la Ville, une fiche de prise de décision ou un projet de signalisation, il est impératif que les éléments soient proprement identifiés et correctement orthographiés. Ce guide a pour objectif de dresser les balises d’écriture spécifiquement pour les éléments en usage dans les différentes directions à la Ville de Lévis. Cela permettra d’uniformiser les pratiques d’écritures, le bon usage des références et de s’assurer de la bonne orthographe. Chaque toponyme, c’est-à-dire un nom de lieu, est adopté par résolution du conseil, il est donc nécessaire que son usage soit fait de manière appropriée. L’écriture et le bon usage des noms de lieux sont des éléments balisés par les normes et principes de la Commission de toponymie du Québec, qui relève de l’Office de la langue française du Québec.1 Quartier ou secteur Pintendre? Rue Bernières ou rue de Bernières? Voilà des exemples où vous trouverez les précisions dans ce guide et les bons usages à appliquer. Vous trouverez également à la fin du document une série d’outils et de liens qui vous seront certainement utiles dans d’autres projets de rédaction. <br><br>LES ARRONDISSEMENTS L’arrondissement est une entité qui est créée en fonction de la Charte de la Ville de Lévis pour la répartition des pouvoirs et des compétences administratives. Le territoire de la ville est divisé en trois arrondissements : <br>• Arrondissement Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Ouest (CCO) <br>• Arrondissement Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Est (CCE) <br>• Arrondissement Desjardins Dans l’usage approprié des noms d’arrondissements, on évite d’utiliser la particule « de » ou « des ». Par exemple : √ Usage approprié : « dans l’arrondissement Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Ouest » X Usage à éviter : « dans l’arrondissement des Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Ouest » <br><br>Bien que l’usage usuel « dans l’Ouest » et « dans l’Est » soit généralement répandu dans l’appareil administratif pour désigner l’arrondissement Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Ouest ou Est, il n’est pas recommandé d’en faire usage avec les citoyens afin d’éviter toute confusion. Rappelons que pour certains, l’expression « dans l’Est » peut également correspondre avec l’arrondissement Desjardins, qui se trouve physiquement dans l’est de la ville. L’arrondissement a d’abord un caractère administratif et n’est pas utilisé à des fonctions de localisation ou d’identification, à l’instar d’un nom de rue ou de secteur. Les noms des arrondissements reprennent essentiellement ceux des deux anciennes MRC présentes sur le territoire de Lévis. Il s’agissait des MRC des Chutes-de-la-Chaudière et Desjardins. [Texte à revoir si les noms d’arrondissements sont changés] <br><br>LES SECTEURS Les secteurs sont des entités rappelant les anciennes municipalités qui composent aujourd’hui la ville. Les secteurs n’ont aucune valeur juridique ni administrative, contrairement aux districts électoraux et aux arrondissements, et ne sont utilisés qu’à des fins de précision et de localisation. Puisque le territoire de Lévis est grand, le nom de secteur peut être utilisé pour préciser un lieu. Par exemple : « Un concert aura lieu ce soir au parc de l’Anse-Benson dans le secteur Saint-Romuald. » « La partie se déroulera à l’aréna André-Lacroix, secteur Lauzon. » Dans l’usage approprié des noms de secteurs, on évite d’utiliser la particule « de ». Par exemple : √ Usage approprié : « dans le secteur Saint-Romuald » X Usage à éviter : « dans le secteur de Saint-Romuald » Cette dernière expression réfère davantage à « dans les environs de… ». Les noms de secteur officiels reconnus par la Commission de toponymie du Québec sont les suivants : <br>• Secteur Saint-Nicolas <br>• Secteur Bernières* <br>• Secteur Saint-Étienne-de-Lauzon <br>• Secteur Saint-Rédempteur <br>• Secteur Charny <br>• Secteur Sainte-Hélène-de-Breakeyville ou Breakeyville <br>• Secteur Saint-Romuald <br>• Secteur Saint-Jean-Chrysostome <br><br><br>• Secteur Saint-David* <br>• Secteur Lévis <br>• Secteur Pintendre <br>• Secteur Saint-Joseph-de-la-Pointe De Lévy <br>• Secteur Lauzon* * Ces noms réfèrent à d’anciennes municipalités fusionnées avant la formation de l’actuelle Ville de Lévis. La limite du secteur est généralement celle de l’ancienne municipalité qu’il représente. Le nom de secteur ne doit jamais être utilisé dans une adresse postale. Depuis 2015, le seul nom de municipalité accepté par Postes Canada sur notre territoire est Lévis. Pour abréger certains noms, il est accepté d’utiliser la désignation Breakeyville en remplacement de Sainte-Hélène-de-Breakeyville ainsi que Saint-Joseph en remplacement de Saint-Joseph-de-laPointe De Lévy. <br><br>LES GÉNÉRIQUES Le générique est la désignation technique du type de voie. En ce sens, une rue et un boulevard n’ont pas la même signification. Les génériques les plus courants sont les suivants : rue, avenue, route, chemin, boulevard et côte. Les génériques « boulevard » et « avenue » désignent réfèrent davantage à une réalité urbaine et commerciale alors qu’à l’inverse, le chemin réfère à une réalité rurale et est d’importance secondaire par rapport à une route. Pour en savoir davantage sur la définition de chacun des génériques, nous vous invitons à consulter le guide produit à cette fin par la Commission de toponymie du Québec. 2 Il est nécessaire de s’assurer que le générique choisi reflète adéquatement la réalité. À ce sujet, nous pouvons rappeler l’exemple du boulevard Méthot dans le secteur Saint-Nicolas, qui constitue une certaine curiosité. Il s’agit bien d’un boulevard au niveau technique, mais il se trouve dans un quartier résidentiel qui ne correspond en rien à une agglomération densifiée qui nécessiterait ce type d’infrastructure. Le générique doit toujours être écrit en minuscule, sauf sur une plaque de nom de rue ou un panneau de signalisation, ou lorsqu’il est placé dans une liste, un tableau, une carte ou un graphique. Par exemple : 2175, chemin du Fleuve; 795, boulevard Alphonse-Desjardins <br><br>LA HIÉRARCHIE DES ENTITÉS Il est important que chacun des éléments soit correctement orthographié, mais également bien utilisé. Deux types de hiérarchie doivent être utilisés, l’une administrative, l’autre pour la localisation. La hiérarchie administrative place en ordre d’importance les entités qui concernent l’aspect administratif ou politique de la municipalité. Elle est utilisée, par exemple, pour une demande de permis, une requête administrative, un processus électoral municipal ou tout besoin concernant un service de la ville. Les éléments se déclinent ainsi en ordre d’importance : Ville, arrondissement, district électoral, nom de rue, numéro de porte. La hiérarchie de localisation est davantage d’ordre pratique. Elle sert à informer, localiser et préciser un lieu pour différents services. Les éléments se déclinent ainsi en ordre d’importance : Ville, arrondissement, secteur, quartier, nom de rue, numéro de porte. <br><br>PARCS ET ESPACES VERTS À l’instar d’un nom de voie de circulation, le nom d’un parc est toujours composé d’un générique, d’un spécifique de particules et parfois même d’un qualificatif. Dans cette catégorie, le générique est souvent « parc », il peut être également un espace, une terrasse, un quai, un belvédère, un parcours, etc. Tout comme la voie de circulation, il est indispensable que le générique choisi soit bien approprié. Le générique doit toujours être écrit en minuscule, sauf sur un panneau de signalisation ou lorsqu’il est placé dans une liste, un tableau, une carte ou un graphique. Par exemple : <br>• Parc des Chutes-de-la-Chaudière <br>• Le paysage est spectaculaire au parc des Chutes-de-la-Chaudière Il arrive parfois que le générique soit accompagné d’un qualificatif. Par exemple un parc régional, un parc linéaire, une réserve écologique, etc. Dans ces cas, le qualificatif doit être écrit en minuscule. Par exemple : <br>• Le parc régional de la Pointe-De La Martinière <br>• La réserve écologique de la Grande plée Bleue En ce qui a trait au spécifique, il s’agit des mêmes règles d’écriture applicables aux noms de voie de circulation. <br><br>ÉDIFICES MUNICIPAUX Quelques édifices municipaux ont été nommés afin de commémorer la mémoire d’une personne ou en rappel d’un élément particulier. Le générique choisi est en fonction de l’usage du bâtiment : édifice, caserne, aréna, etc. Tout comme pour les voies de circulation et les parcs, le générique doit toujours être écrit en minuscule, sauf sur un panneau de signalisation ou lorsqu’il est placé dans une liste, un tableau, une carte ou un graphique. Le prénom et le nom sont toujours séparés par un trait d’union. Lorsque le spécifique honore la mémoire d’une personne, il est impératif de bien écrire le nom, en respect à la personne commémorée. Par exemple : <br>• Aquarena Léo-Paul-Bédard et non pas Aquarena Léopold-Bédard Pour s’assurer de la bonne orthographe du nom d’édifice, nous vous invitons à consulter le répertoire toponymique.",N/A,dgagne@ville.levis.qc.ca,46.808333,-71.183333

quebec_saint-lazare,,record,Saint-Lazare,Quebec,Yes,"1. Objectifs La Ville de Saint-Lazare a, en 1994, procédé à l’officialisation des odonymes de voies de circulation situées sur son territoire et depuis nous appliquons cette procédure pour toutes nouvelles voies de circulation. À ce jour, nous comptons 517 toponymes soit 478 noms de voies de circulation, 25 toponymes pour les parcs et espaces verts, 8 lieux habités et 6 entités hydrographiques. En 2014, le conseil a décidé de créer un comité consultatif (toponymie municipale) (CCTM) ayant comme mandat l’élaboration d’une politique de désignation toponymique et odonymique dans le but d’officialiser la méthodologie d’attribution des noms (r. 03-79-14). La politique établit les règles, les critères et les procédures qui vont permettre à la Ville de traiter avec transparence, équité, uniformité, cohérence et efficacité les demandes. Le principal objectif qui guidera le comité dans l’analyse de nouvelles demandes et dans l’élaboration de ses propositions en regard aux toponymes et aux odonymes sera en lien avec le caractère identitaire du territoire, soit par sa vocation équestre, son patrimoine sylvestre, naturel, paysager et culturel et par ses personnages exceptionnels. Le comité devra également composer et s’adapter avec les nouveaux ensembles immobiliers dits contemporains à celui de notre caractère identitaire. <br><br>5. Critères 5.1 Critères fondamentaux Le comité devra orienter ses recommandations en se basant sur les critères de la Commission de toponymie du Québec à savoir : a) Unicité du nom de lieu : Tout lieu ou entité géographique ne se voit attribuer qu'un seul nom officiel. b) Usage : Les toponymes dont l'usage est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s'ils ne dérogent pas à d'autres critères. Dans les cas d'usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. c) Langue de l'élément générique : L'élément générique est en français. d) Présence et unicité du générique : Un nom d'entité naturelle ou artificielle comporte habituellement un générique. Un odonyme en comprend toujours un. Un nom d'entité administrative peut en comporter lorsque le lieu désigné n'est pas une municipalité, un autre lieu habité ou un lieu-dit. Cependant, un nom géographique ne peut comprendre plus d'un terme exerçant la fonction d'un générique. e) Utilisation de génériques conformes : Les noms d'entités administratives et les nouveaux noms de voies de circulation doivent présenter des génériques conformes aux avis terminologiques. f) Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d'un (1) an : Un lieu ne doit pas se voir attribuer le nom d'une personne vivante ou décédée depuis moins d'un an. g) Utilisation d'un nom déjà officiel : Lorsqu'on utilise un toponyme officiel ou l'élément spécifique d'un toponyme officiel pour composer un autre toponyme, on en respecte intégralement la forme. 5.2 Critères spécifiques Le comité, en plus des critères fondamentaux, devra analyser les demandes en fonction des critères spécifiques suivants : a) favoriser les noms de personnes exceptionnelles au niveau de l’histoire et de la culture en utilisant le nom et le prénom; b) favoriser le nom d’une personnalité qui s’est particulièrement illustrée au sein de la communauté en utilisant le nom et le prénom; c) favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement de la Ville; d) dans le cas d’une demande en provenance d’un particulier, la demande devra être déposée avec la signature d’un minimum de 20 personnes; e) favoriser les noms de l’ancêtre d’une famille souche; f) favoriser le nom des pionniers qui ont bâti et façonné la Ville; g) favoriser la désignation d’un sentier récréatif, d’un caractère sylvestre, champêtre et équestre; h) favoriser la désignation d’un parc par le nom de la voie de circulation la plus près; i) interdire la désignation alphanumérique des voies de circulation; j) exiger une thématique dans le cas d’un ensemble immobilier; k) exiger pour la désignation des voies de circulation des noms associés au thème d’un ensemble immobilier; l) favoriser la désignation d’un espace vert ou de conservation en utilisant des éléments floristiques et fauniques caractérisant le milieu naturel environnant; m) permettre une désignation composée dans le cas d’une fête ou d’un évènement (exemple : Saint- LazARTS). 5.3 Dérogation aux critères spécifiques Il est possible, dans un cas exceptionnel, qu’une recommandation déroge aux critères spécifiques énumérés à l’article 5.2. Dans ce cas un argumentaire doit être déposé par le requérant et inscrit au procès-verbal du comité. <br><br>6.

ontario_caledon,,record,Caledon,Ontario,Yes,"Corporate Streeet Naming Policy: Policy Statement: Under the provisions of the Municipal Act, 2001, S.O. 2001, c.25, the municipality has final street name approval authority. The Town, in consultation with the Region of Peel Street Names Committee, maintains the Caledon Reserve List of Approved Street Names (the Caledon Reserve List) for use in the naming of new streets or the renaming of existing streets. Scope: This policy applies to all staff, Council, the Region of Peel Street Names Committee, the development industry, property owners and businesses for the naming of both public and privates streets. Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to establish criteria for the naming of streets in the Town of Caledon, encouraging the use of street names of local significance. General Guidelines a) Street names that exhibit the following elements will be given preference:  Names that are easily pronounced;  Names that are spelled how they are pronounced;  Names that represent specific themes;  Names that reflect local heritage, traditions and character;  Names that recognize local features and geography;  Names that recognize native wildlife, flora, and fauna. b) Street names that exhibit the following elements will not be considered:  Names that are already in use within the Region of Peel;  Names with complex or unconventional spellings;  Names that may be spelled in a number of different ways;  Names with elements such as hyphens, apostrophes or dashes;  Names that are spelled differently but sound similar to existing or reserved street names;  Names that could be pronounced in several different ways;  Names that may cause confusion in an emergency situation, such as names of a well-known location (i.e. Lakefront) or emergency services terminology (i.e. Chase);  Names that use numbers;  Names that denigrate individuals or groups;  Names based on identifiable ethnic or racial groups, or religious affiliations;  Names generated for marketing needs; Names with sexual overtones;  Names that may be considered offensive due to inappropriate humour, parody, slang or double meanings. 1. Maximum Number of Street Names with Same First Three Letters Once the number of street names starting with the same first three (3) letters reaches thirty (30), no further street names with these same first three (3) letters will be approved. This restriction is due to the limitation of the Region’s Fire and Emergency Services computer system, which can only display a maximum of thirty (30) street names at a time. The current list of three-letter combinations that have reached this maximum is available on the Street Name Index on the Region of Peel website. 2. Two-Word Names Single word street names are preferred, but because of the number of existing streets in the Region of Peel, two-word street names will be considered. Where possible, these names will be changed into one-word street names. 3. Use of Prefixes Street name prefixes are words that precede a street name. The prefix “Old” should only be used to rename a separated part of an existing street. The alterative spelling of “Olde” shall be avoided to eliminate any spelling confusion. The prefix “New” shall not be used under any circumstance. The prefix “Saint” shall be written out in full, rather than in short form (St.). 4. Use of Suffixes Street name suffixes are words that follow a street name, generally indicating the street’s configuration and, on occasion, street direction. Suffixes are proposed by the applicant for review by Heritage Resource staff. 5. Historical Names The Town requires a minimum of one (1) street name of historical significance in each new development, and encourages more where possible. These names shall commemorate local history, including notable individuals, families, events, land use, structures and sites. The applicant shall consult Heritage Resource staff regarding pre-approved or proposed names of historical significance appropriate to the location of the proposed development. 6. Individuals Living Individuals Streets named after living individuals are discouraged as the individual may encounter future circumstances that lead to inappropriate connotations for his or her name. Use of a living person’s name requires written consent of the individual, a written description detailing the individual’s contribution to the Town and/or community, and Council (or its delegated authority) approval. No street may be named after an elected official unless they have retired from public service. Posthumous Streets named after an individual posthumously require written consent from the individual’s surviving family, a written description of the individual’s contribution to the Town and/or community, and Council approval (or its delegated authority). Names of individuals who are national or international public figures do not require written consent from surviving family members. Veterans Streets named in honour of Town residents who served or who lost their lives while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces or the Police or Fire departments are encouraged. Special signage entailing a poppy symbol may be used for all streets named in honour of military veterans. 7. Businesses or Industries Streets named after existing businesses and industries shall not be considered as such names represent a form of advertising that may affect other businesses or industries in the area. 8. Intersecting Streets Where a minor road or collector road crosses an arterial road or a major collector road, each section of the minor road or collector road shall be assigned a different name. This is to ensure that emergency services may reach a destination in a timely and efficient manner. 9. Street Names as Prizes Street names shall not be used as a prize or as a silent auction item.",Reserve List of Approved Street Names: https://www.caledon.ca/en/town-services/street-naming.aspx#Heritage-names,N/A,43.8507,-80.00073

If an objection is raised, it should be referred to the Committee for consideration and recommendation. 8) Since the new Municipal Act does not require the registration of a street naming or renaming by-law, the following process shall be followed in the interest of cost effectiveness: a. If the subject highway is included in the Land Title Registry at the Registry Office, and the highway or portion thereof to be named or renamed is PINNED, describe the subject highway and include the PIN number; b. If the subject highway is in the Registry System, there are three (3) options available: i. Pass the by-law containing a description such as ""that portion of Street located between and Street.""

The Township has final determination for approving a new installation. <br>• The bench and/or tree must not interfere with the enjoyment of, or accessibility to, park areas and shall not interfere with the general maintenance of the park. <br>• The Township does not permit the placement of flowers, wreaths, pictures, etc., at the site or the addition of fixtures to or around the donated item. <br>• Every attempt will be made to notify the participant if the bench and/or tree must be relocated. <br>• The term of a commemorative memorial bench is ten (10) years.

City Council shall have the final decision with respect to naming of City Parks and Facilities. 17. City Council shall follow the procedure attached to this Policy with respect to the process, public notice, consultation in advance of any decision with respect to Naming or Re-Naming. 18. The following considerations and principles apply to any consideration of renaming: i. Renaming on account of values should be an exceptional event. - There are many reasons to honour tradition; - Historical names can be a source of knowledge and often carry wisdom not immediately apparent to a current generation; no generation stands alone at the end of history with perfect moral hindsight; - It is a virtue to appreciate the complexity of those lives and historic events that have given shape to the world in which we live; - The presumption against renaming is strongest when a park or facility has been named for someone who made a major contribution to the City, the Province or the Nation. ii. Sometimes renaming on the basis of values is warranted. Three distinct timeframes should be considered: a. The era in which honourific lived and worked; b. The time of a naming decision; c. The present. Page 5 of 10 Each timeframe offers relevant information. Considering the three timeframes noted, consideration should be given to the following: - Does the principal legacy of an individual or organization conflict with the vision and values of the City today? - Human lives are large and contain multitudes, individuals may have both virtues and vices; - Interpretations of principal legacies are subject to change over time and may vary in the eye of the beholder; - Consider the long lasting or enduring impact of an honourific; - Altering the interpretation of a principal legacy associated with an honourific is not done easily; - The principal legacy is only one consideration and should be considered with the other principles for re-naming; - Was the principal legacy significantly considered in the time the honourific lived and was it considered at the time of the naming; Re-naming is more likely to be warranted when there was not an appropriate consideration of principal legacy that was well documented at the time the person lived and the naming was done; - Does a Park or facility whose honourific that has a principal legacy that his deemed to be in conflict with the values of the City play a substantial role in forming the sense of community of the City; If a Park or Facility has a long-standing name that has created bonds and connections among generations of community members, these bonds can be a reason to keep a name; iii. A decision to re-name a park or facility comes with an obligation of non-erasure. - When a name is altered, the City has a responsibility to ensure that the removal does not have the effect of erasing history; - It is incumbent on the City to ensure if a renaming is done that affirmative steps are taken to avoid erasure such as exhibits, installations, plaques, signs and public area or other such creative means considered appropriate by the community and Council.",Application form for naming a park of facility: https://www.owensound.ca/en/exploring/resources/Documents/Application-Form-for-Naming-a-City-Park-or-Facility.pdf <br><br>Application for renaming a park of facility: https://www.owensound.ca/en/exploring/resources/Documents/Application-Form-for-Re-Naming-a-City-Park-or-Facility.pdf,N/A,44.56981,-80.93067

POLICY 1.1 The Township of South Stormont seeks to ensure consistency and fairness in naming of corporate assets, utilizing key criteria to determine the appropriateness of each proposed commemorative name. Furthermore, the Township encourages public involvement encouraging a community oriented approach to naming corporate assets. 2. PURPOSE 2.1 This policy provides clear guidance regarding commemorative naming of corporate assets, including parks, open spaces or facilities in the Township of South Stormont 3. NAMING PRINCIPALS 3.1 Only parks, facilities and assets in common use by the public, such as parks, parts of parks, facilities, parts of facilities shall be considered specifically for naming. 3.2 Council makes all final decisions concerning signage including wording that is placed on municipal facilities and assets. 3.3 Council shall retain the right to not name certain facilities and assets of broad importance. 3.4 Commemorative naming is the recognition of individuals or events of significance. 4. IMPLEMENTATION CRITERIA 4.1 Where the naming of any municipal asset including parks, open spaces, facilities, municipal buildings, or parts of municipal buildings or properties is being requested for the purpose of recognizing individuals, at least one of the following criteria shall apply: 4.1.1 The nominated individual shall have demonstrated excellence, courage, or exceptional service to the citizens of the Township of South Stormont, the Province of Ontario and/or Canada; 4.1.2 The nominated individual shall have an extraordinary community service record; 4.1.3 4.1.4 4.1.5 4.1.6 4.1.7 The nominated individual shall have worked hard to foster equality and reduce discrimination; The nominated individual shall have risked or given his/her life to save or protect others; Where the nominated individual is a current Township employee, the individual shall have made an outstanding contribution to the Township of South Stormont outside of his/her capacity and duties as a Township employee or they may be recognized for their exceptional service once they are no longer an employee; An individual may be recognized for a significant financial contribution to a park of facility. In instances where financial contributions are tied to a financial sponsorship agreement such agreement conditions shall prevail; and The nominated name has historical significance. Where the naming of any municipal asset including parks, open spaces, facilities, municipal buildings, or parts of municipal buildings or properties is being requested for purposes of an event of significance the process shall remain as set out in Section 6 of this Policy. CONSENT 5.1 Names relating to individuals or family names will require the consent of the family member or estate and a written history outlining the contribution made or the historical significance of the individual/name must be submitted with the application form. 5.2 Where a name proposed relates to an individual or family name having historical significance and there are no known relations or estate contact, the historical significance and contributions must be recorded and documented. <br><br>RENAMING The renaming process shall be identical to the Commemorative naming process. Council is the final authority for approving the proposed park or facility name. The renaming process differs in that it entails the discarding of an old name, which most likely has become an important part of the community. Thus, the need for public input is required. It shall be recognized that this need for public input must also be balanced with the need to protect the confidentiality of the person or family after whom the existing facility or park is being renamed.",N/A,N/A,45.0856,-74.92183
ontario_southgate,,record,Southgate,Ontario,Yes,"Street Naming Policy: 1.0 OVERVIEW: 1.1 All requests for street and municipal parks names shall be made in writing. The requests shall include background information concerning the rationale for the request, geographical association (if applicable), biographical information and documentation providing support for the request. The applicant must assume responsibility for obtaining the support for the request where applicable. 1.2 Where the name of an individual is used, approval shall be obtained from his/her family if available. 1.3 Potential street and park names will be compiled into a list by the Planning and Development Services. 1.4 All potential Street names will be forwarded to the Planner, with distribution to the Public Works Manager, for their review prior to being forwarded to Council for consideration and approval. 1.5 The Planner will be responsible for assigning street names either individually or through the subdivision agreement process. 1.6 6 Street names can be added to the compiled list from time to time as they are suggested through submission with a complete justification and history from citizens or public service groups and are formally adopted by Council. 4.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES a) Street names that exhibit the following elements will be given preference: <br>• Names that are easily pronounced; <br>• Names that are spelled how they are pronounced; <br>• Names that represent specific themes; <br>• Names that reflect local heritage, traditions and character; <br>• Names that recognize local features and geography; <br>• Names that recognize native wildlife, flora, and fauna. b) Street names that exhibit the following elements will not be considered: <br>• Names that are already in use within the Grey County; <br>• Names with complex or unconventional spellings; <br>• Names that may be spelled in a number of different ways; <br>• Names with elements such as hyphens, apostrophes or dashes; <br>• Names that are spelled differently but sound similar to existing or reserved street names; <br>• Names that could be pronounced in several different ways; <br>• Names that may cause confusion in an emergency situation, such as names of a well-known location (i.e. Lakefront) or emergency services terminology (i.e. Chase); <br>• Names that use numbers; <br>• Names that denigrate individuals or groups; <br>• Names based on identifiable ethnic or racial groups, or religious affiliations; <br>• Names generated for marketing needs; <br>• Names that may be considered offensive due to inappropriate humour, parody, slang or double meanings. 1. Two-Word Names Single word street names are preferred, but because of the number of existing streets in the Grey County, two-word street names will be considered. Where possible, these names will be changed into one-word street names. 2. Use of Prefixes Street name prefixes are words that precede a street name. The prefix “Old” should only be used to rename a separated part of an existing street. The alterative spelling of “Olde” shall be avoided to eliminate any spelling confusion. The prefix “New” shall not be used under any circumstance. The prefix “Saint” shall be written out in full, rather than in short form (St.). <br><br>4. Individuals a) Living Individuals Streets named after living individuals are discouraged as the individual may encounter future circumstances that lead to inappropriate connotations for his or her name. Use of a living person’s name requires written consent of the individual, a written description detailing the individual’s contribution to the Township and/or community, and Council (or its delegated authority) approval. b) Posthumous Streets named after an individual posthumously require written consent from the individual’s surviving family, a written description of the individual’s contribution to the Township and/or community, and Council approval (or its delegated authority). Names of individuals who are national or international public figures do not require written consent from surviving family members. c) Former Reeves & Mayors A list of former Southgate Reeves and Mayors (which will be updated following each development application) for consideration is attached to this policy as Schedule A for the Village of Dundalk, Township of Egremont, Township of Proton and the Township of Southgate. No street may be named after an elected official unless they have retired from public service. d) Veterans Streets named in honour of Township residents who served or who lost their lives while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces or the Police or Fire departments are encouraged. Special signage entailing a poppy symbol may be used for all streets named in honour of military veterans. 5. Businesses or Industries Streets named after existing businesses and industries shall not be considered as such names represent a form of advertising that may affect other businesses or industries in the area. 6. Intersecting Streets Where a minor road or collector road crosses an arterial road or a major collector road, each section of the minor road or collector road shall be assigned a different name. This is to ensure that emergency services may reach a destination in a timely and efficient manner. When a road that runs North and South or East and West has a 90 degree turn in the roadway to continue in a third direction must be named with a different street name to avoid confusion for emergency response. 7. Street Names as Prizes Street names shall not be used as a prize or as a silent auction item. 8. Naming of Parks Where a past Mayor or Reeves name cannot be used for a street name because of a Grey County policy conflict, the Township should consider using those names for naming of Parks and Sports Fields in the community. 9. Naming of Community Facilities The Township policy for naming of community facilities is to generate where possible, revenues to support the operating costs of these types of buildings. Businesses and corporations with interest in naming rights will execute a 5 to 10 year agreement to benefit both parties with the signage, promotion and exclusivity.",Street Name Bank Bottom of Document: https://www.southgate.ca/en/local-government/resources/documents/By-laws-and-Policies/Policy-Listing/69_Street-Naming-Policy.pdf,N/A,43.12462,-81.36614

They may include:  The name of the street or adjacent street where the property resides.  The neighbourhood, community or subdivision which the property serves.  A noteworthy physical, environmental, topographical or scenic characteristic.  Proximity to a recognizable facility or area. 2.4 Historic a) Historically based names would be appropriate for properties where there is a common, recognizable connection between the property and an historic event. These should reference:  A local, provincial or national historical or heritage event.  A long standing and commonly used name associated with the property. 2.5 Gift or Donation a) Council will consider naming a property or property feature in recognition of an individual, family, service club or corporate entity that has made a significant financial gift to the Town. This can be through direct financial contribution, donation or conveyance of property. A benchmark value for such a situation would be a minimum donation of 30% of the total real or capital cost of the property, project or property feature, although Council at its sole discretion shall determine whether the gift is significant enough to apply a naming opportunity. 2.6 Person/Organization a) Naming a property after a particular person, organization, group or family would be considered in situations where this entity:  Has an historical connection to a site – such as an original landowner or pioneer.  Has made a significant contribution to the quality of life and well being of the community through: o service as an elected representative of government; o service as a member of a public board or commission; o significant, long serving volunteerism in the community; o recognized environmental, historical and conservation efforts; o artistic, cultural, scientific or athletic achievement; o national or international recognition for contributions to society. b) Requests for the naming of property after a person, family, organization or similar entity may be submitted by that entity for consideration.

In addition, the following shall apply:  Background information, documentation and rationale supporting the request shall be required.  Written permission by the person, family, estate or legal representative directly connected with the proposed name shall be submitted.  Circulation of the request shall be undertaken to related Departments and internal stakeholders for comment.  Consultation with external stakeholders in the community may be undertaken to determine the level of support or potential objections.  Presentation and staff report to Council for review and approval or denial of the request. 2.7 Naming and Renaming- General a) Once established, the property or feature name shall be used to reference the property. Unless specifically stated, the name will carry forth in perpetuity, for the life cycle of the building or property feature, until the property or feature is significantly altered, or Council chooses to rename the property or feature. b) Council may also direct that a property or feature be renamed if circumstances arise where by the existing name of a property or feature would then be considered a name not eligible according to the policy. 2.8 Naming of Parks a) Parks shall generally be named after the street upon which the park property has its main frontage. Additionally parks may be named for other aspects of the area’s geography, and/or for corporations, service clubs or individuals who have made a major contribution to the park’s development either physically or financially. b) Where names of this latter group are utilized it should be general practice to apply the groups name with that of the street or geographic feature, to retain the way finding and location benefits the name can provide, (i.e. Kiwanis Heydenshore Park). 2.9 Naming of Trails and Open Space a) Trails and open space shall generally be named after the adjoining active park area (i.e. D’Hillier Open Space), again to retain the way finding aspects provided by the name. Further trails and open space may utilize the naming procedures set out above for parks. 2.10 Reports to Council a) Staff shall not be required to prepare a report to Council if the naming of a park, open space or trail conforms to the policy as noted above, and specifically the name selected is the appropriate geographic name. b) Staff shall prepare a report for Council’s consideration in the following instances:  Development of major new municipal facilities or additions to existing facilities.  Where the property or facility or part thereof is the subject of a major gift or donation.  Naming for corporate sponsorship for municipal properties, facilities and components thereof.  Where a person or organization has made a written request to name a particular property or facility.  Where there is an identified concern related to confusion in naming or the appropriateness of a name.  Where otherwise directed by Council. 2.11 Corporate Sponsorship a) Corporate sponsorship is undertaken primarily for parks and recreation property features under the supervision of the Manager of Sponsorship and Advertising. Included in this activity is the sale of naming rights for specific properties and property features. Examples include corporately named arenas at Town sports facilities and the lounge at the Port Whitby Marina Clubhouse. Such sponsored names are offered for a specific time period at an agreed upon fee. Naming under corporate sponsorship shall abide by the provisions of names not eligible contained in this policy. b) Corporate sponsorships for municipal properties, facilities and components of facilities would be approved by Council.",N/A,N/A,43.9325,-78.954445

quebec_sherbrooke,,record,Sherbrooke,Quebec,Yes,"Mission du comité de toponymie Le comité de toponymie se réunit pour alimenter la banque de toponymes afin que celle-ci ait suffisamment de noms pour répondre aux besoins de la ville dans tous les domaines comme les rues, boulevards, parcs, édifices, ruisseaux, etc. Le comité évalue les propositions de désignation et fait des recommandations au conseil municipal. Le comité doit s’assurer que les toponymes reflètent les aspirations de la population, tout en rappelant l’histoire et le milieu naturel de la ville. <br><br>Règles toponymiques Pour le fonctionnement du comité de toponymie et pour toutes les personnes désirant une définition relative à la toponymie, la référence du comité est le site Internet de la Commission de toponymie du Québec, section terminologie géographique, ainsi que le Grand dictionnaire terminologique de l’Office québécois de la langue française. L’usage des noms composés La justification d’utiliser des noms composés s’explique de la façon suivante : l’ajout du prénom permet de préciser qui l’on veut honorer. La Ville voulait honorer M. Louis Bilodeau, le toponyme devait être autoroute Louis-Bilodeau. En écrivant autoroute Bilodeau, est-ce Louis que l’on voulait honorer ou est-ce la famille Bilodeau? Aussi, en écrivant seulement le patronyme (nom de famille) avec le nombre de noms de rues que la ville possède, on manquerait de noms. Les noms composés permettent d’honorer plusieurs membres d’une même famille ou encore des personnes sans parenté mais ayant le même patronyme. Nous n’aurions pu honorer M. Jacques O’Bready, puisque la rue O’Bready existait déjà. La rue O’Bready pour Moïse O’Bready, le père de Jacques O’Bready. Demande de désignation Toute personne morale ou physique qui désire soumettre un toponyme doit compléter le formulaire en annexe. Les informations servent au comité de toponymie afin d’évaluer la proposition de désignation. Adoption des nouveaux toponymes Nouvelles thématiques de noms de rues : Les nouvelles thématiques sont recommandées par le comité de toponymie et adoptées par le conseil. À chaque thématique sont associés des toponymes qui sont recommandés par le comité et adoptés par le conseil, puis versés dans la banque de toponymes. Désignation des rues locales : Le Service de la planification et du développement urbain (SPDU) est responsable de la désignation des nouvelles rues locales. Les noms de ces rues ont été recommandés par le comité de toponymie et adoptés par le conseil municipal au préalable. Le SPDU utilise les noms de la banque de toponymes. Désignation des parcs, des édifices publics et des grandes artères : Le SPDU propose au conseil municipal le futur nom qui est issu de la banque de toponymes. Le comité peut formuler une recommandation. Le conseil adopte la proposition. Le conseil doit en tout temps approuver un nouveau toponyme avant que celui-ci ne soit versé dans la banque des toponymes. Tous les toponymes adoptés par le conseil sont transmis à la Commission de toponymie du Québec pour officialisation. <br>RÈGLES ET CRITÈRES TOPONYMIQUES Au Québec, les Municipalités et Villes sont responsables du choix des odonymes (nom des voies de communication) sur leur territoire. La référence en toponymie est le site Web de la Commission de toponymie du Québec, section Normes et procédures. 7.1 Critères de choix de la Commission de toponymie du Québec Les principaux critères toponymiques de la Commission de toponymie du Québec identifiés dans la présente Politique servent de référence pour le choix des toponymes municipaux. L’ensemble des critères de choix de la Commission de toponymie du Québec est précisé sur le site Web de la Commission de toponymie du Québec, section Normes et procédures, sous-section Critère de choix. 7.1.1 Unicité du toponyme Puisque les toponymes sont nécessaires pour nos déplacements et notre localisation (ex. : services d’urgence) sur un territoire donné, il ne peut exister deux toponymes municipaux identiques, ce qui engendrerait des confusions de lieu. 7.1.2 Unicité du nom du lieu Toute entité géographique ou lieu municipal ne se voit attribuer qu'un seul nom officiel. De la même façon, la Commission de toponymie du Québec n'officialise qu'un seul nom pour une voie de communication ou pour chacun de ses tronçons. 7.1.3 Absence de doublon, d’homophone ou d’homographe Pour des raisons de sécurité publique et considérant que les odonymes composent les adresses des immeubles, la présente Politique n’autorise aucun doublon, homophone ou homographe pour les noms des voies de communication puisque ceux-ci pourraient engendrer une confusion de lieux. 7.1.4 Usage courant Les toponymes dont l'usage est le mieux établi doivent avoir priorité s'ils ne dérogent pas à d'autres critères. Dans les cas d'usages parallèles et également répandus, on accorde la préférence aux noms qui répondent le mieux aux autres critères. Le respect de l'usage courant est l'un des critères fondamentaux en toponymie. 7.1.5 Pérennité des toponymes Considérant que la toponymie est un des outils servant à mieux connaître notre histoire, notre territoire, nos milieux naturels, notre diversité culturelle et nos personnages et familles importants, il est donc contraire à la présente Politique et à celle de la Commission de toponymie du Québec de faire disparaître un toponyme en le remplaçant par un autre. Ainsi, ce n’est que très exceptionnellement, en cas de force majeure, qu’un changement de nom puisse être envisagé. 7.1.6 Langue du générique Le générique est en français. Toutefois, en ce qui concerne les entités naturelles, la langue du générique peut n'être pas française si l'importance du lieu désigné est locale et si le nom de ce lieu est en usage exclusivement dans cette langue autre que française. 7.1.7 Langue du spécifique Sauf exception justifiable, il est de règle de conserver dans leur langue d’origine les mots de la langue générale qu'un usage local a consacrés, en particulier si leur utilisation présente un intérêt certain en raison de leur valeur culturelle ou historique. On officialise dans leur langue d'origine les spécifiques des toponymes amérindiens et inuits. Pour leur part, les points cardinaux inclus dans les odonymes et qui renseignent sur l'identité d'un tronçon par rapport à un autre ou sur la direction de la voie sont en français. Dans les cas d'usages concurrents d'une forme française et d'une forme dans une autre langue, la Commission de toponymie du Québec privilégie la première si l'usage local en est significatif. Par ailleurs, les mots de la langue générale qui entrent dans la composition des toponymes créés par la Commission de toponymie du Québec sont en français. 7.1.8 Choix des caractères Pour l’officialisation des toponymes autochtones, on utilise les caractères de l’alphabet latin. 7.1.9 Exclusion des noms de personnes vivantes ou décédées depuis moins d’un an Seuls les noms de personnes décédées depuis plus d'un an et ayant une importance historique certaine ou un lien étroit avec le lieu à désigner peuvent faire l'objet de tels choix. Lorsqu'un nom rappelant une personne vivante a un usage attesté depuis dix ans ou plus, ce nom peut être officialisé s'il répond aux trois conditions suivantes : a. Il est constitué d'un prénom, d'un nom de famille, d'un titre ou d'un surnom seul; b. Il ne fait pas référence à une personnalité notoire; c. Il ne désigne pas une entité majeure. 7.2 Autres critères de choix de la Ville Outre les précédents critères de choix de la Commission de toponymie du Québec, les critères de la présente section doivent guider dans le choix des toponymes municipaux. 7.2.1 Choix non controversé Le toponyme doit être un choix non controversé, c’est-à-dire que : a. On évite l'emploi de toponymes à connotation péjorative ou grossière, de même que les choix susceptibles de provoquer ou d'alimenter une opposition. b. On s'abstient d'employer des toponymes trop banals et ceux dont l'existence est largement répandue. c. Il faut proscrire l'utilisation des nombres et des lettres comme base de dénomination de lieux. d. On condamne l'attribution de toponymes qui peuvent servir de réclame à des marques de commerce ou à des entreprises commerciales ou industrielles. e. Il importe d'éviter les duplications de toponymes avec les municipalités avoisinantes pour éliminer toute confusion. 7.2.2 Caractère logique de la désignation Pour toutes désignations toponymiques, il doit y avoir l’existence d’un lien pertinent entre le toponyme proposé et le lieu à désigner (ex. : localisation et secteur, importance, thématique ou concept, etc.), et ce, dans le respect du système odonymique existant, s’il y a lieu. Par exemple, la notoriété du toponyme doit être reliée à la longueur de la voie de communication ou à l’importance du parc ou de l’édifice municipal. 7.2.3 Utilisation du même odonyme pour le prolongement de voies de communication Dans les cas de prolongement de voies de communication, les nouveaux tronçons doivent porter le même odonyme que le ou les tronçon(s) existant(s), et ce, malgré un ou plusieurs changement(s) de direction du tronçon projeté. Ce critère doit être appliqué pour des raisons de sécurité publique et considérant que les odonymes composent les adresses des immeubles puisque ceux-ci pourraient engendrer une confusion de lieux. 7.3 Critères de priorisation des toponymes Les critères de priorisation de la présente section doivent guider dans le choix des toponymes municipaux. 7.3.1 Majorité de toponymes féminins La présente Politique vise à adopter annuellement principalement des toponymes féminins, préférablement aux toponymes masculins, afin d’atteindre ultimement l’équité et la parité de toponymes homme-femme. Vu le nombre de toponymes masculins plus important dans les noms actuellement officialisés, une très grande majorité de toponymes féminins sont retenus, sauf exception, et ce, prioritairement pour les entités municipales significatives. 7.3.2 Sentiment d’appartenance et représentativité de notre diversité culturelle Le toponyme est susceptible de renforcer le sentiment d’appartenance à la Ville de Sherbrooke. Il met en valeur l’identité sherbrookoise, les lieux d’appartenance, la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que le caractère bilingue de l’arrondissement de Lennoxville, en plus de favoriser le développement de Sherbrooke vers une mosaïque de noyaux urbains. La présente Politique vise à prioriser annuellement les noms issus de la diversité culturelle. 7.3.3 Critères d’analyse d’une désignation L’analyse des toponymes municipaux doit se baser sur les critères d’analyse que la Ville s’est donnés dans la désignation des toponymes municipaux, à savoir, par ordre de priorité : 1) Évoquer, prioritairement, la mémoire d’une personnalité féminine historique ou contemporaine, prioritairement une personne de la ville ou de la région, qui a marqué significativement l’histoire ou l’actualité récente de Sherbrooke ou de la région et qui s’est distinguée dans un ou plusieurs domaine(s) suivant(s) : artistique, culturel, communautaire, économique, éducatif, littéraire, politique, militaire, religieux, scientifique, social et sportif (ex. : centre communautaire et culturel Françoise-Dunn, rue Micheline-Goulet, rue Idola-Saint-Jean, parc Hélène-Boullé, rue Yolande-Vanier); 2) Évoquer, prioritairement, un terme, un personnage (prioritairement une femme), un lieu, un fait ou un événement historique ou contemporain abénakis ou en lien avec les Premières Nations, prioritairement de la ville ou de la région, pour permettre une meilleure représentativité des toponymes abénakis (ex. : rue Pimihlôsek, rue Alsigon, rue des Abénaquis, lac des Nations, rue Kateri, rue des Inuits); 3) Évoquer, prioritairement, un terme, un personnage (prioritairement une femme), un lieu, un fait ou un événement historique ou contemporain qui fait référence à l’inclusion et à la diversité culturelle de la ville ou de la région pour permettre une meilleure représentativité de l’identité sherbrookoise, des lieux d’appartenance et de la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que du caractère bilingue de l’arrondissement de Lennoxville (ex. : chemin des Écossais, rue Little Forks (utilisé par les premiers voyageurs et colons anglophones pour la confluence des rivières Saint-François et Massawippi), rue Fabi sherbrookoise, les lieux d’appartenance, la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que le caractère bilingue de l’arrondissement de Lennoxville, en plus de favoriser le développement de Sherbrooke vers une mosaïque de noyaux urbains. La présente Politique vise à prioriser annuellement les noms issus de la diversité culturelle. 7.3.3 Critères d’analyse d’une désignation L’analyse des toponymes municipaux doit se baser sur les critères d’analyse que la Ville s’est donnés dans la désignation des toponymes municipaux, à savoir, par ordre de priorité : 1) Évoquer, prioritairement, la mémoire d’une personnalité féminine historique ou contemporaine, prioritairement une personne de la ville ou de la région, qui a marqué significativement l’histoire ou l’actualité récente de Sherbrooke ou de la région et qui s’est distinguée dans un ou plusieurs domaine(s) suivant(s) : artistique, culturel, communautaire, économique, éducatif, littéraire, politique, militaire, religieux, scientifique, social et sportif (ex. : centre communautaire et culturel Françoise-Dunn, rue Micheline-Goulet, rue Idola-Saint-Jean, parc Hélène-Boullé, rue Yolande-Vanier); 2) Évoquer, prioritairement, un terme, un personnage (prioritairement une femme), un lieu, un fait ou un événement historique ou contemporain abénakis ou en lien avec les Premières Nations, prioritairement de la ville ou de la région, pour permettre une meilleure représentativité des toponymes abénakis (ex. : rue Pimihlôsek, rue Alsigon, rue des Abénaquis, lac des Nations, rue Kateri, rue des Inuits); 3) Évoquer, prioritairement, un terme, un personnage (prioritairement une femme), un lieu, un fait ou un événement historique ou contemporain qui fait référence à l’inclusion et à la diversité culturelle de la ville ou de la région pour permettre une meilleure représentativité de l’identité sherbrookoise, des lieux d’appartenance et de la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que du caractère bilingue de l’arrondissement de Lennoxville (ex. : chemin des Écossais, rue Little Forks (utilisé par les premiers voyageurs et colons anglophones pour la confluence des rivières Saint-François et Massawippi), rue Fabi sherbrookoise, les lieux d’appartenance, la diversité culturelle de la population ainsi que le caractère bilingue de l’arrondissement de Lennoxville, en plus de favoriser le développement de Sherbrooke vers une mosaïque de noyaux urbains.

Par ailleurs, en écrivant rue de Québec, nous savons qu’il s’agit de la ville de Québec et non de la province, que l’on aurait écrit rue du Québec; le spécifique : le spécifique est habituellement un nom propre comme un patronyme, un nom de ville, de pays, de région) ou un nom commun (comme celui d’une roche, d’une fleur, etc.); la notice : la notice explique le spécifique.

Critères fondamentaux La politique de désignation toponymique et odonymique doit permettre à la Ville d’identifier le meilleur choix de toponymes et d’odonymes en s’appuyant sur certains critères fondamentaux soit :<br> − Éviter le choix d’un nom dont l’attribution pourrait provoquer une controverse;<br> − Éviter les noms à consonance semblable qui pourraient confondre le repérage par les services d’urgence;<br> − Éviter le choix d’un nom d’une personne encore vivante. Seuls les noms de personnes décédées depuis plus d’un an peuvent faire l’objet d’une autorisation de la Commission de toponymie du Québec;<br> − Éviter l’attribution de noms qui peuvent servir de réclame à des marques de commerce ou à des entreprises commerciales ou industrielles;<br> − Restreindre l’utilisation de points cardinaux, à moins qu’ils ne désignent de façon précise une entité géographique ou qu’ils fassent partie d’un toponyme existant;<br> − Favoriser la mise en valeur d’un lieu en choisissant un nom qui s'inspire du milieu naturel environnant (flore, faune, géologie, etc.);<br> − Maintenir la même appellation sur tout le parcours d’une artère, en particulier pour les boulevards;<br> − Obtenir un consentement de la famille concernée par la dénomination, si possible. <br><br>3. Désignation des parcs et espaces verts municipaux Pour la désignation des parcs et espaces verts municipaux, il convient de respecter les critères selon l'ordre de priorité qui suit :<br> − Favoriser le nom de la voie de circulation la plus proche;<br> − Favoriser le nom du secteur administratif dans lequel le futur parc ou espace vert va s'implanter;<br> − S’inspirer des caractéristiques du milieu naturel environnant (Exemple : île Bray);<br> − Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particulièrement illustrées au sein de leur communauté;<br> − Favoriser le nom des pionniers qui ont bâti la municipalité;<br> − Favoriser le nom de l’ancêtre d’une famille de souche;<br> − Favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement de la ville. <br><br>4.

Désignation des places publiques et monuments<br> Les places publiques ou monuments sont des éléments structurants du milieu et significatifs pour les citoyens. Il est donc important que l’attribution d’un nom soit représentative du milieu historique, culturel ou communautaire. Ainsi, il est recommandé de fixer le choix sur les critères suivants :<br> − Favoriser les noms issus de l'histoire et du patrimoine local;<br> − Favoriser le nom des personnes qui se sont particulièrement illustrées au sein de leur communauté;<br> − Favoriser le nom d’une personnalité publique qui a apporté une contribution exceptionnelle au développement de la ville;<br> − Favoriser le nom des pionniers qui ont bâti la municipalité;<br> − Favoriser le nom de l’ancêtre d’une famille de souche;<br> − Favoriser le nom de la voie de circulation la plus proche;<br> − S’inspirer des caractéristiques du milieu naturel environnant.<br><br> Définition :<br> − Place commémorative : espace public découvert dont le nom et l'aménagement visent à rappeler le souvenir d'un événement ou à honorer la mémoire d'une personne.

Procédures<br> Les étapes relatives à l’attribution de toponymes et d’odonymes sont les suivantes :<br> ATTRIBUTION DES TOPONYMES <br>1. Le Service d'urbanisme reçoit les projets de développements du territoire de la Ville. <br>2. Le Service d'urbanisme transmet les propositions des nouveaux noms au Comité de toponymie. <br>3.

Une lettre d'acceptation de la famille concernée doit être obtenue lorsqu'un nom d'un individu est proposé. (Exemple : Ange-ÉmileSéguin). <br>4. Le Conseil municipal, après avoir pris connaissance du rapport du Comité de toponymie, adopte par résolution, avec ou sans changement, les toponymes / odonymes proposés. Le Conseil peut également demander au Comité de toponymie un rapport supplémentaire. <br>5. Après réception de la résolution, le Service du greffe envoie les nouveaux toponymes à la Commission de toponymie du Québec, accompagnés de cartes de localisation et de l’origine des noms. <br>6. Réception d'une réponse d'officialisation de la Commission de toponymie du Québec par le Service du greffe. <br>7.

Introduction Le guide de commémoration de la Ville de Victoriaville est un outil de référence à préconiser lorsqu’un sujet fait l’objet d’une demande de commémoration. Ce guide établit des principes et des critères d’analyse afin de mieux orienter les choix de commémoration. Il permet également de favoriser une équité dans le traitement des demandes de commémoration. <br><br>1.1 Les objectifs d’un cadre d’intervention municipal L’objectif général du cadre d’intervention est de fournir des balises communes aux divers intervenants municipaux. Les objectifs spécifiques sont les suivants :<br> • Structurer les interventions de la Ville en définissant les limites et la portée de ses champs d’intervention en matière de commémoration;<br> • Améliorer la cohérence des actions commémoratives entre les divers services municipaux;<br> • Développer et encadrer les modalités de participation des citoyens à la commémoration; • Faire connaître à la population et aux visiteurs différents aspects de l’histoire de la ville. <br><br>2. La commémoration <br><br>2.1 Les principes La commémoration d’un sujet doit reposer sur les principes suivants :<br>  Se fonder sur des renseignements historiques exacts;<br>  Favoriser les noms complets des personnes;<br>  Éviter les noms à consonances semblables qui pourraient confondre le repérage par les services d’urgence;<br>  Rechercher un équilibre entre la notoriété de l’objet de commémoration, l’importance et la signification du lieu à nommer;<br>  Il faut s’assurer de la qualité artistique et technique des réalisations, de leur durabilité raisonnable, de leur caractère sécuritaire, de leur originalité et de leur intégration harmonieuse au tissu urbain;<br>  Si un texte accompagne le repère commémoratif, il doit être rédigé avec clarté et concision;<br>  La commémoration doit favoriser la représentation des différents groupes de la société, tels que les femmes, les autochtones, les minorités visibles ou les personnes en situation de handicap;<br>  Tout projet de commémoration respectera le cadre légal, réglementaire et normatif établi par la Ville de Victoriaville et les gouvernements, le cas échéant.<br><br> 2.2 Les sujets de commémoration Les sujets de la commémoration peuvent prendre plusieurs formes :<br>  personnes<br>  groupes<br>  événements<br>  institutions<br> composantes du territoire<br>  bâtiments<br>  sites <br>  Ceux-ci doivent obligatoirement se rapporter à la Ville de Victoriaville, à son histoire et à celle de ses citoyens, à ses fonctions et à ses caractéristiques.<br><br> Les sujets de la commémoration doivent tenir compte des valeurs fondamentales suivantes : inclusion, innovation, culture, coopération, développement durable, patrimoine, sécurité.<br><br> 2.3 Évaluation d’une demande de commémoration <br>L’évaluation des projets de commémoration tiendra compte des principes généraux énoncés précédemment ainsi que des critères de pertinence suivants : <br><br>2.4 Critères de pertinence :<br>  Le sujet de la commémoration (personnalité, groupe, institution, site, bâtiment, concept, événement) doit avoir eu une importance significative dans l’histoire de la Ville de Victoriaville;<br>  Le sujet de la commémoration a nécessairement valeur d’exemple, de modèle ou de référence pour la communauté. En général, il se démarque aussi par son originalité, son caractère innovant ou sa contribution exceptionnelle à la collectivité;<br>  Le sujet de la commémoration doit avoir eu une influence durable. Par prudence et selon la coutume, on laissera s’écouler au moins un an entre le décès d’une personne (ou du dernier membre d’un groupe) et sa commémoration;<br>  Lorsque le sujet de la commémoration est une personne, son nom fait partie de la banque municipale de toponymes;<br>  L’intervention commémorative ne doit pas être disproportionnée par rapport à son sujet;<br>  L’intervention commémorative ne doit pas constituer une promotion commerciale.<br>  La commémoration devrait être idéalement reliée à une date significative, associée de préférence au système décimal : décennies, siècles et fractions de siècles. Dans le cas de personnages, les dates de naissance ou de décès serviront de point de référence, de même que les dates soulignant des événements importants de leur carrière. <br><br>3. Traitement d’une demande <br><br>3.1 Les procédures de soumission des projets de commémoration<br> La Ville de Victoriaville désire favoriser l’engagement des citoyens en matière de patrimoine et permettre l’appropriation du patrimoine de proximité par les collectivités locales. Toute personne ou tout organisme peut proposer une intervention commémorative par l’intermédiaire du site Web de la Ville de Victoriaville. Les étapes de traitement d’une demande de commémoration :<br>  Remplir le formulaire de demande (disponible en ligne ou en version papier);<br>  Transmettre le formulaire à la Ville;<br>  Traitement de la demande par le responsable du comité de toponymie;<br>  Étude de la demande par le comité de toponymie pour recommandation au conseil municipal;<br>  Présentation au conseil municipal;<br>  Suivi au demandeur.<br><br> 3.2 La coordination et la gestion générale<br> Une demande de commémoration est reçue par le Service de la gestion du territoire et du développement durable. La personne responsable du comité de toponymie traite la demande, informe et consulte tout service municipal pouvant être concerné par la demande. La demande est soumise au comité de toponymie et est évaluée notamment en fonction des éléments suivants :<br>  La pertinence de la demande, en fonction des critères établis dans le présent guide;<br>  Les coûts associés au projet, à l’entretien et aux coûts récurrents;<br>  Les ressources financières disponibles;<br>  L’implication des différents services municipaux pour la planification, la réalisation ou encore l’entretien des installations découlant du projet.",N/A,vincent.poirier@victoriaville.ca,46.056667,-71.951389

quebec_sorel-tracy,,record,Sorel-Tracy,Quebec,Yes,"Politique de commémoration: 3. Objectifs Les objectifs poursuivis par la commémoration sont de faire connaître, tant à la population qu’aux visiteurs, les différents aspects de notre histoire qui ont façonné et composent l’identité de la société soreloise. Ses buts sont aussi de définir, par les références au passé, lointain ou plus récent, sa fonction actuelle dans l’histoire socio-économique et culturelle de la région de Sorel-Tracy, du Québec et du Canada. Ce faisant, l’acte de commémoration invite à la réunion d’une population autour d’une valeur partagée, dans la limite spécifique de son territoire. Ceci doit se faire en balisant son territoire d’objets de signification, temporaires ou pérennes, adaptés à la valorisation du sujet et intégrés à son urbanisme dans le respect des lois et des normes d’urbanisme en vigueur. 4. Principes directeurs L’intervention de commémoration doit prouver sa pertinence et son équilibre entre son sujet, le lieu, la forme et les moyens mis en œuvre. L’intervention commémorative se base sur plusieurs principes : 1. Les sujets doivent se rapporter à tout ce qui a fait l’histoire socioculturelle du territoire couvert par la ville de Sorel-Tracy. 2. L’exactitude historique et la rigueur intellectuelle est la condition sine qua non de l’étude approfondie d’un dossier. 3. Les sujets /objets de commémoration doivent être consensuels, objectifs, en évitant au maximum la controverse. 4. Les qualités esthétiques d’un objet de commémoration doivent être adaptées à l’environnement qui l’encadre. 5. L’intervention commémorative, ponctuelle ou permanente, ne doit pas être disproportionnée par rapport à son sujet. 6. Les promoteurs de l’intervention commémorative doivent rechercher l’équilibre entre la clarté du message et les moyens mis en œuvre dans la commémoration. 7. Si toutes les composantes de la communauté soreloise doivent pouvoir faire l’objet de commémorations, celles-ci doivent rester proportionnelles à leur importance dans la société soreloise. 5. Les sujets de commémoration Lorsqu’une demande de commémoration est déposée, elle devra nécessairement s’inscrire dans : Les valeurs fondamentales : Page 3 de 19  Démocratie  Justice  Culture  Langue  Éducation  Religion  Innovation  Technologie  Humanisme Les composantes sociales et les personnes, telles que :  les Premières nations,  les familles souches,  les communautés culturelles,  les artistes et artisans,  la vie démocratique, économique et sociale. Les institutions : Les organismes privés ou publics, qui se sont investis, entre autres, dans les domaines éducatif, culturel, religieux, humanitaire, économique et écologique.

britishcolumbia_surrey,,record,Surrey,British Columbia,Yes,"TITLE: COMMUNITY IDENTITY The policy of community identity in the Municipality is as follows: (a) Continue the promotion of town identity by replacing existing wood street signs by reflecting aluminum signs painted a different combination of colours for each town. (b) Promote distinctive architectural styling in different areas and ensure all public buildings conform to the theme. The provision of suitable designed street furniture (benches, bus shelters, garbage containers, light standards, etc.) can also contribute to the character of the area. (c) Alert the Surrey Museum & Historical Society of the desire to retain community identity at the town and village level. Through their contact with the residents and private or public organizations, they could continue to promote the historic aspects of established areas. (d) Utilize place names representing the unit to which the facility is attached when naming public buildings. For example, libraries, public health centres and community centres are facilities located in town centres and should adopt names reflecting the identify of the town. Secondary schools, district parks and fire halls should be named after the village they serve. In addition, private and community organizations should be encouraged to use place names in connection with their services (church, apartment buildings, shopping centers). (e) Place names should be retained on all the official maps and documents of the Municipality. This could possibly include reference to place names on monthly or yearly billings for Municipal services. Also, the Canada Post Office has indicated that postal addresses such as Cloverdale; Surrey; Port Kells; Surrey; Crescent Beach; Surrey, etc., are acceptable so long as the house number, street number and the designation Surrey, BC, are included.",N/A,crichardson@surrey.ca,49.111667,-122.8275

There shall be no similar sounding names, ie., "" MacDonald"" and "" MacDonnell"". A7. If the above conditions are satisfied, the developer of the street may choose the name providing that it is consistent with all other policies in this Schedule. A8. Should there not be a name forwarded by a developer, the Civic Addressing Coordinator will select one suitable for the community from a pool ofpossible road names to be compiled from the names of CBRM residents who lost their lives serving in the Canadian Armed Forces or while serving as an emergency response official; for some communities, pools of names may be developed based on other criteria. A9. Where a new road is a continuation of an existing road, the new road will be given the same name as the existing road wherever possible; where a new road is not a continuation of an existing road different names must be used. A10. Suffixes to be used are listed in Table One. Al 1. Road names, including unabbreviated suffixes, shall have no more than 24 characters. Al2. Use of the word "" extension"" in a name is prohibited, and use of any word commonly considered vulgar, racist or sexist is prohibited.

Renaming of existing streets shall be discouraged unless the renaming will reduce the likelihood of confusion in the event of an emergency. A16. There shall be no similar sounding names, ie., "" MacDonald"" and "" MacDonnell"" within a community or adjacent communities. Similar sounding names should be avoided altogether ifpossible. A17. Where the road to be renamed is the continuation of another road the same name should apply wherever possible; applying different names to different sections of the same road is discouraged. Where the road to be renamed is not a continuation of another road the two roads should have different names. A18. Road renamings are subject to the approval of the General Committee and may be initiated by the Civic Addressing Coordinator, the General Committee, or by residents of affected properties. A19.

Establish civic policy to guide the City of North Vancouver's Streets and Parks Naming<br>Committee for the naming of parks, municipal facilities, streets and honourary roads;<br>2. Establish the criteria to recognize and commemorate noteworthy persons whereby the names<br>will be placed on a Names Reserve List;<br>3. Establish principles for the naming of parks, municipal facilities, roads, and honourary roads;<br>1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES:<br>1. All naming shall be posthumous. Naming after living individuals is inappropriate since there<br>could be future circumstances or difficulties that a living individual encounters in their future<br>that leads to an inappropriate connotation for that name.<br>2. Naming a park, municipal facility, road or honourary road after a person shall be<br>commensurate with the contributions made by the person during their lifetime and having<br>regard to the person's achievements or areas of interest.<br>3. Written consent should be obtained from the individual's surviving family (if applicable); and,<br>4. A written description of the individual's contribution to the City and/or community should be<br>reviewed by City Council.<br>2. NAMES RESERVE LIST<br>1. All naming shall be posthumous.<br>2. For a person's name to be added to the reserve list, the person must meet, except in<br>extenuating circumstances, at least one of the following criteria:<br>a) A person who demonstrates excellence, courage or exceptional dedication to service in<br>ways that brought special credit to the City of North Vancouver;<br>b) A person who volunteered and gave extraordinary help or care to individuals, families or<br>groups, or supported community services or humanitarian causes in the City of North<br>Vancouver;<br>COUNCIL POLICY<br>01 Corporate Administration<br>Civic Naming Committee Policy - Page 2 of 2<br>c) A person who fostered equality and reduced discrimination;<br>d) A person who risked his or her life to save or protect others; and<br>e) A person who achieved a deed or activity performed in an outstanding professional<br>manner that brought considerable benefit or great honour to the City of North Vancouver.<br>3. Names, other than a person, may reflect a historical event significant to the City of North<br>Vancouver.<br>4. Names, other than a person, may recognize the flora and fauna of the local area or the<br>geographical or topographical feature of the local area.<br>5. Notwithstanding the above, the name of a person or a name other than a person, not identified<br>on the ""Names Reserve List"" may be assigned to a park, municipal facility, road or an<br>honourary road when unique or extenuating circumstances warrant.<br>3. GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHEN A NAME IS ASSIGNED TO A PARK, MUNICIPAL FACILITY,<br>HONOURARY ROAD, STREET OR RENAMED STREET<br>1. Naming a park, municipal facility, street or honourary road after a person shall be<br>commensurate with the contributions of the person being honoured and having regard to the<br>person's achievements or areas of interest and other comparable people who have or may in<br>the future be commemorated.<br>2. No municipal parks, facilities, roads or honourary roads to be named after staff members or<br>former Council members of the Corporation of the City of North Vancouver.<br>3. Honourary Roads<br>a) A road, either whole or in part, may be named in honour of a person or organisation (e.g.<br>Veteran's Way) as an honourary road. This is supplemental to the actual road name which<br>does not change in this instance.<br>DOCUMENT HISTORY<br>Date Action By<br>July 16, 2012 Approved Council<br>October 21, 2013 Amended Council",N/A,NA,49.320556,-123.073889
britishcolumbia_portclements,,record,Port Clements,British Columbia,No,N/A,"In our community there has been a pattern to officially name streets/roads after types of trees (Spruce Street, Alder Avenue, etc) or after family names of people who lived in the first houses on the road (Ryland Road, Tingley Street, etc). I think the tree names come about from our history as a logging community, which is still a dominant industry in our community.<br><br><br><br>Typically, the naming of municipal property like parks has been more about their function/purpose or features such as Millennium Memorial Park (built to celebrate the millennium, 2000, as well as a memorial to WWI and WWII soldiers and its where we hold our Remembrance Day service), Sunset Park (to highlight the view from the trails, and we are known for our sunsets, so to emphasize that feature), and the Community Park being the first park built for the community’s enjoyment. Rainbow Wharf was named after a call-out to the community for a name, and I think a referendum was held to make the selection. The approach seems to be case-by-case basis, and not all our places/infrastructure have official names (ex. our sewer lagoon is just the sewer lagoon, the public works yard, is just the public works yard, etc). Often the default is “Port Clements X” like our Port Clements Community Hall, and we just recently renamed the Port Clements Firehall to the Craig Beachy Memorial Firehall (after our late Fire Chief after a request from a resident) – the full name of the millennium park is Port Clements Millennium Memorial Park, and community park is the Port Clements Community Park.<br><br><br><br>Our community’s name, Port Clements, was due to a deal with the local MP, Herb Clements, when the town had to be renamed (as Queenstown was taken), that in exchange for naming the community after him a federal wharf would be built in the community (our Rainbow Wharf). I believe such arrangements involving federal MPS (and provincial government levels) are now illegal, but this occurred back in 1914.<br><br><br><br>There is also a habit of referring to buildings after the property owners (ex. Abfam Apartments), but that is colloquial references, not official place naming by the Village.",deputy@portclements.ca,53.685556,-132.183611
britishcolumbia_northcoastregionaldistrict,,record,North Coast Regional District,British Columbia,No,N/A,"The NCRD does not have a formal policy regarding Place Names nor how they would be changed, despite being one of the early local governments to participate in such things (i.e. Queen Charlotte Islands to Haida Gwaii; Skeena-Queen Charlotte Regional District to North Coast Regional District, Village of Queen Charlotte to Village of Daajing Giids; Jap Inlet to Hunt’s Inlet, etc).<br><br>We have handled issues of name changes for our member municipalities or First Nations communities historically by accepting the wishes of the community as they are. If Place Name changes are proposed (we have recently had such communications come forth regarding a geographic point of interest rather than a community for example), we bring those items to the Board of Directors for any comments or concerns which may need to be brought forth by the original Party. In my time here, there have not been any issues raised at the table when name changes have come up with the Board, but of course we see some fresh faces every election cycle.",planning@ncrdbc.com,53.75,-132
